        Input elements are just like any other elements - they are tags.
        Here, I've made a button, right in the middle of my paragraph.
        <button type="button">Button</button>
        It probably looks silly in the middle of a paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are multiple ways to make buttons, but using the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>
        tag is preferred.
        See the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/button">button documentation</a>.

        Just like anything else in HTML, you can style buttons to make them
        look any way you like. If you don't do anything, they may be ugly.
        <button>Plain</button>
        <button style="background-color: red; border: none; color:white">Red</button>
        <button style="background-color:lightblue; border: 2px solid blue; color:blue; border-radius: 5px">Blue</button>
        Of course, if you do something, it might still be ugly.
        There are lots of style sheets around the web that make nice looking buttons.
        See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp"> this page for ideas.</a>

        Like other HTML elements, buttons can have classes and IDs. The latter will be
        really important for finding particular buttons when we start programming.
        Here are a few buttons with their appearance styled with CSS that is
        in the css at the top of the file:
    </p>
    <div>
        <button class="onebutton" id="button11">One</button>
        <button class="onebutton" id="button12">Two</button>
        <button class="onebutton" id="button13">Three</button>
    </div>

    <p>
        Look at the CSS and HTML for those buttons and understand why they look
        and behave the ways that they do. Experiment with changing the CSS to make
        them look different.
