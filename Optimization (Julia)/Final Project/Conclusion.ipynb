Then, elaborate with a description of the problem that will be solved, a brief history (with [citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation) where appropriate) of how the problem came about, why it's important/interesting, and any other interesting facts you'd like to talk about. You should address and explain where the problem data is coming from (research? the internet? synthetically generated? something you have collected personally, or by surveying your friends?) Also give an outline of the rest of the report.\n",
