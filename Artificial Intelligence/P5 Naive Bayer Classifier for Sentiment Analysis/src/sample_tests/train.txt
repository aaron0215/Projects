0	This film is a very funny film The violence is bad the acting isWell Dani stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do The random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexuallyfrustrated goth lads in Personally i think this movie really does suck The story and characters COULD be very good if say the directing the actors and other little nibby things were made better But the film is just bad the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has Danni in it This film is possibly the worst Brate film ever And believe me thats hard to achieve especially when youre competing with Def by Temptation and over crappy excuses for serious horror movies Im not a CoF fan and so i just see this as another rubbish movieA really bad one If Dani made this as a comedy then good going him Very well done Over than that though i rate it low for its crappiness Watch it when youre in a happy happy joy joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if youre high on multiple different types of drugs
1	I enjoyed this film yet hated it because I wanted to help this guy I am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music businesswho are now still trying to become adultsno more fansgroupiesmoney etcand they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular lifeas they see the new bands etc getting the spotlightit is almost like they have to begin anewthis film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the 70s and 80s are going through nowand thats where I find the film sad and depressingBUT it portrays the life of an old rock starabandoned and lostin a believable wayThe young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of Hollis maclaren Outrageousand she is one lady in a film you will cheer for This film is a must have for folks in their 50s who have seen the rise and fall of bandspeople who knew the members and have watched them hurt as age creeps inand popularity fadesThis is an almost perfect moviesad but in a way positivebecause of the whales A MUST SEE
1	I enjoyed Longstreet which followed in the steps of Raymond Burrs successful Ironside TV series and was intended to give it competition But this show was canceled after one season because it was decidedI believe wronglythat Longstreet was not able to compete with Mr Burrs Ironsidebr br I may add that the pilot for this show was especially well done and very memorable I hope that a box set of Longstreet will appearbr br Writers should note that this story idea was only briefly explored here and that much more could and should be done to show the play and interplay of disabilities on TV
1	Although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is specialbr br If youve never seen this film before youll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disneys Aladdin cribbed from the film They loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makersbr br Ive given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten which is where a good portion of this film dwells because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing Everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end From the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting It doesnt kill the film but it does weaken itbr br Still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale or even a great movie
1	I found it hard to like anyone in this film The central characters Lindy and Michael Chamberlain whose daughter disappears during a night out in the Australian outback are not bad people but then surely not all or even most of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better But though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the Chamberlains from the start of their lifes tragic disarray the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip news media crowds mobs and assumptions Its not a movie about the degenerate society of Australia in particular its merely an account of a true story that happened there Society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we arebr br When a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigines dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines newspapers and TV programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of ones own unaware perceptions influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround ones life The reason I appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out from the victims to the massesbr br The evidence against Lindy Chamberlain aside suspicion was jetfueled mostly by a virtue of hers To the public eye she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter Why was she able to keep her cool even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up for TV and the press How much of the downward spiral couldve been prevented had she behaved more to the publics liking in the media Meryl Streep one of if not the greatest actress working today may not give a performance that particularly stands out and frankly neither does any other actor or department of filmmaking But she and the screenwriters do understand Lindy What is infuriating is that its not that difficult Apparently she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case Whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situationbr br Whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as Sophies Choice The Devil Wears Prada Angels In America or other such work it is a triumph It is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself She frustrates us because we dont know what shes thinking or feeling It took me awhile to feel endeared toward her but this is the movies way of suggesting the reaction of the publics attentionbr br She is married to a pastor and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most Initially they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to Gods will kickstarting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughters death was some sort of ritual killing on their part Whatever happened to the little girl her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the medias intake didnt immediately identify so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungrywellbr br Meryl Streep and Sam Neill are constantly on screen but the Australian public plays the real leads here Like punctuation for each plot advance director Fred Schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office where the public tries Lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projectionsbr br This GolanGlobus docudrama is not particularly memorable The settings atmosphere doesnt give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out But it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public
1	Like the Arabian Nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that theres plot plot and more plot it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life then plunges into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind mans present where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come It must be admitted that the second half doesnt quite live up to the promise of the first Like the Arabian Nights it tries to cram as many MiddleEastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work A freed genie a beautiful princess a flying carpet fantastic mechanical toys sea voyages a crowded marketplace a wicked vizier jewels I dont know why it all works but it does Everything is just so beautiful The sets are beautiful June Duprez is beautiful Rozsas score is especially beautiful As usual it sounds Hungarian but somehow he manages to convince us that hes being Hungarian in a Persian way

1	First let me say that Before Sunrise like all movies is NOT a movie for all tastes It appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people For me like most folks here Before Sunrise struck a deep chord in me I was truly stunned moved inspired by it This is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing It creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine It is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings I got from itbr br The movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other It is very intelligent and inspiring not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of Jesse and Celines discussions but rather the little nuances the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other It captures an honest romantic yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime Viennese milieu it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world And what happens after that night is open for debate but I never doubt that they wont each other againbr br The facile comments by RockytheBear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this moviebr br See it and it may change your way of life
1	This was another World War II message to the soldiers and to the Allies to be careful about spreading rumors These were called instructional cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funnylooking main character called Pvt Snafubr br All of us have imaginations along with fears and whathaveyou and thats what happens here as Pvt Snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with five You can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them That includes losing confidence in your country and your cause as pointed out here in this cartoon A good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy Thats still being done today br br We lost the war declares one big baloney near the end of this cartoon Amazing how some Americans still havent learned This cartoon may be 65 years old but it sure has relevance today As I write this there were two terrorist bombings in Europe today and some people still think the War On Terror is just a bumper sticker slogan Amazingbr br The writer the famous Dr Suess uses analogies of hot air balloon juice here to present the above message With Theodore Geisel his real name you know the rhymes will be cleverbr br Nothing hilarious here but it wasnt meant to be You have to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that was out there during World War II People forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning It was a tense time
0	Thats not just my considered verdict on this film but also on the bulk of what has been written about it Now dont get me wrong here either Im not a total philistine I didnt hate the movie because it wasnt enough like police academy 9 or whatever I enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff I swearbr br Magnolia is poor and I am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed Long winded self indulgent rambling nonsense from start to finish there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie Theres some high calibre actors fair enough and none turns in an average or worse performance Furthermore my wife a self confessed Tom Cruise hater tells me its his career best performance by far But the plot is so completely unengaging meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snails pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or somethingbr br It doesnt help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with well I didnt think so but I dont like most people admittedly They all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in everso intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route Yadda yadda yadda The soundtracks dire as well with that marrowsuckingly irritating quality that I had hitherto thought unique to the music of Alanis Morisettebr br All in all it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of Friends whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat The bit with the frogs is good though
1	I found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while I tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why One of the problems is the culturallanguage one Here we have a ChineseTaiwaneseJapanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading English subtitles inevitably loose some of the subtleties Another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and coincidences Nevertheless it seems unlikely that there is a wholly bad Miiki film and this certainly is not that Plenty of stylish and bone crunching violence a window upon some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect All in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one
0	This sure is one comedy Im not likely to forget for a whilebr br Wouldnt normally bother to comment on this movie its so minor that no one would watch it anyway but as it happens its kind of popular in p2p sharing networks such as Kazaa and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it isbr br So what is it then Well of course its not really a comedy instead its intended as a horror flick intended very much being the key word here The script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess the special effects are only special in that theyre especially pathetic and as for the acting well lets just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school my teachers would have burst out crying at our talentbr br Of course I realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower ones expectations certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned Also even though Im a big fan of the horror genre Im aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch actingbr br But stillbr br Bmovies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding such as humour The only laughs in Cradle to Fear lie in the ridiculous performances If you can find the humour in thatand I could for the first 20 minutes or so gradually dozing off after thatthen thats going to be the only thing the movie has to offer Oh that and two or three pairs of breastsbr br Woohoo how excitingbr br As for the story its not even that it doesnt try to convey anything the victims either use drugs andor are involved in serious crime The lesson Watch out naughty boys and girls because one day youll be made to pay for what youve donebr br I rest my casebr br So all in all a little bit of sex a fair amount of drugs but absolutely zero rock n rollbr br I rate this one 1 out of 10 but would go to 0 if I could Or perhaps I wouldnt it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors names correctly in the titles I mean thats something innit
0	This film actually works from a fairly original idea Ive never seen nymphs that were thrown out of heaven in a horror movie before anyway However the way that it executes this idea isnt original in the slightest we follow a bunch of kids that for some reason decide to go on a trip into the forest The fact that the forest is inhabited by these nymphs make it more interesting than merely another forest filled by rednecksnutcaseszombies etc but really the monsters are just a variation on the common horror in the woods theme Many films of this ilk dont have a single good idea and it would seem that this one has worn its brain cells out with just that one The only real asset that the monsters bring to the table is the fact that theyre beautiful women that the characters lust for rather than being hideous grotesques that they want to run away from This is good up until a point but it soon gets boring and the almost complete lack of any backstory surrounding the central monsters ensures that the film is never going get itself out of the horror trash categorybr br Its been years since The Evil Dead made the woodlands a prime horror location and in spite of films like The Blair Witch Project it still makes for an excellent horror setting This is one of the films major assets as the forest presents a good impression of the unknown the only problem is that Forest of the Damned doesnt ever seem to have much up its sleeve The death sequences show a distinct lack of imagination and the fact that all the characters are clichéd in the extreme doesnt help as youre more likely to be looking forward to seeing them get killed rather than hoping they can get away The cast is made up of kids mainly but there is a role here for Tom Savini who unfortunately doesnt get to have fun in the special effects department The only real highlight the film has where personnel are concerned comes from the nymphs themselves The naked ladies tend to look great and if it wasnt for them this film would get very boring very quickly Theres nothing to recommend this film for really but if you want a daft little horror film that harks back to the style of eighties woodland flicks you might find some enjoyment here
0	This movie was terribleI rented it not knowing what to expectI watched the 1st 5 minutes and the movie and knew it was a bombThe acting was bad and there was no plotThe monster is soooooo fakeIt growls and its mouth doesnt moveAlso why would they have a doctor playing a xylophone to kill the monsterJust plain bad dont even waste your time1 out of 10
0	Let me put it another way balls Or how about bolloks This is truly awful more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise Julia Roberts is a skilled actress and usually her work is of the highest standard This movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look proficient Normally she is the consummate professional yet I swear that in her eyes there were signs of bewilderment and despairbr br The one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director Chris Walken turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors Unfortunately that theme wasnt explored to its full potential Too little too latebr br Zeta Jones was wooden Cusack was Cusack and Crystal should stick to acting The two talented exBuffy stars had different experiences Green hopelessly miscast and Balfour underused Well done to Julia for just about preventing this from being the worst movie ever made
0	So Im wondering while watching this film did the producers of this movie get to save money on Sandra Bullocks wardrobe by dragging out her before clothes from Miss Congeniality Did Ms Bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the before Gracie Hart As many reviewers have noted before the film is very formulaic Add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of Cassie Maywether as a somewhat darker Gracie Hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze festbr br The two bad boy serial killers have been done before and better in other films As has the good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence character been seen before In fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypesbr br One last peeve using the term serial killer is false advertising Murdering one person even if its a premeditated murder does not make you a serial killer You may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer
0	this movie basks too much in its own innocence It doesnt tell a story its more a big time snooze fest While the actors are all personable the story is so trite and goes nowhere I think Victor Rasuk has great charisma but deserves a real film from a real storyteller

0	Cuba Gooding Jr is a secret service agent who blames himself over the assassination of the US President ill point out straight away that this is not the type of role that this very talented actor is noted for and this film shows us why He teams up with a persistent news reporter Angie Harmon to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the presidents death and so on blah blah blahbr br Even with a cast of James Woods Cuba Gooding Jr Anne Archer and Angie Harmon End Game fails to grab your attention plain and simple some of the action is good the acting isnt all bad and the story although clichéd and done before could have lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie WELL IT DOESNT The writing of the script and the direction makes absolutely sure of that at no point does it suck you into the story or make you give the slightest thought to any of the charactersbr br 410 Its Boring Predictable and Dull
1	Having read many of the other reviews for this film on the IMDb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based Upon this point I cannot comment having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously However what I can say with certainty is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass Lets be honest here this film is just so much funbr br OK so I must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the characters but lets put this into a clear perspective do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960s Batman series does not remain faithful to the original DC comic book character Or perhaps is there STILL unrest in same persons that the 1980 film version of Flash Gordon was too much of a departure from the original seriesbr br The point is yes this film is incredibly camp but thats precisely its charmbr br Former Tarzan Ron Ely plays the eponymous hero in this and bears more than a passing resemblance to Gary Busey to boot and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles Also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite Michael Berrymanbr br Best scene Far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when Savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke lemonade and milk at a formal occasion Also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein Savage tackles his nemesis Captain Seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen  Pricelessbr br Simply put the film doesnt take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it Great fun from start to finish and youll be singing the John Phillip Sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed
0	Pathetic worse than a bad madeforTV movie I cant believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick For some reason Morgan Freemans character is constantly talking about and saying pussy when referring to NSync boys girlfriend Morgan Freeman calling women pussy is just awkward What the hell were the people behind this film thinking Too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting confusing camera angles a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearablebr br I rented this flop with low expectations but well it really sucked
0	Dont get fooled with all the big names like Burt ReynoldsJames Woods and Anne Archer They are just glorified extras Their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so Whatever their motives for being in this movie if you have an actor like James Woods you better make good use of him To me this is a sign of bad direction through and through The plot itself wasnt that bad And the acting from most of the actors was above average Cuba Gooding Jr however was terrible He was so unbelievable that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes And since this was meant as a serious movie that cant be a good thing The action scenes were not badbut they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting Again better direction was needed Also the pacing was wrong for a movie like this It took the main character almost half an hour to get in action For an action thriller of only 90 minutes that is far too slow The only redeeming factor is Angie Harmon She does her best to make it all work Too bad the director left her hanging Yesthis movie could have been much better with a great director Andy Cheng is far too inexperienced as a director to pull it off And for an actionstunt coordinator of his caliber youd expect at least more exciting action scenes Dont waste your time with this one Avoid
0	Angels who got a little icky were banned from heaven and now reside in a British forest where they seduce and chop up teens Talk about high concept On the plus side this little mother gives us Tom Savini but since his acting range is limited to two minutes screentime his five minute presence seems a tad long The angels run around the forest naked for the most part of the movie but though they might have the body of an angel their faces sure look like Joan Rivers on a bad day Mediocre acting and amateurish goreeffects dont help and the night scenes fatally recall Paris Hiltons most famous movie So bad that it is REALLY bad
1	Every once in a while the conversation will turn to favorite movies Ill mention Titanic and at least a couple people will snicker I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago these same people were moved to tears by that very movie And theyre too embarrassed now to admit itbr br I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time Expecting to simply enjoy the story again I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years I cried again in all the same places It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall yes even more than Star Wars And today many people wont even admit they enjoyed it Folks lets get something straight you dont look cool when you badmouth this film You look like an out of touch cynicbr br No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults Some of the dialogue falls flat and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly However none of this is so distracting that it ruins the filmbr br Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation Wait til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy Kate Winslet was so strong in this film The movie really was hers and she held it together beautifullybr br James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic The sinking scenes were horrific just as they were that night How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me I was utterly transfixedbr br This film is one memorable scene after another Titanic leaving port in Southampton Rose and Jack at the bow flying Iceberg right ahead The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean The screams of the doomed after she went down And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tearsbr br The music which has also been a victim of the films success was a key ingredient James Horners score was simply perfect And the love theme was beautiful and tragic Too bad Celine Dions pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so manybr br I confess I am a Titanic buff As such I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it in all its beauty Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because Ive had such an interest in the ship all my life However I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy The film was made with such humanitybr br Another reviewer said it better than I ever could Open up your hearts to Titanic and you will not be disappointed

1	The movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of Baghdad the jailed prince meets a thief called Abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called Basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with but unbeknown to him the evil wizard Jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her Jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns Abu into a dog This leads to the prince and Abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat Jafa restore peace to Baghdad and marry the princess during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic Genies that takes Abu on a flight through the clouds a giant spider thats really hungry and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seenbr br This is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses genies flying carpets and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs It doesnt have any cheesy moments and the love story isnt a waste of time The production designs are just stunning in this movie From the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter Even though this movie is over 40 years old the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in todays cinema The music and songs are also well done Anyone who sees it will no doubt hail I want to be a sailor sailing on the seas as one of the great musical moments in movies Im usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since I find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but Ill be more than happy to make an exception for this moviebr br What sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you dont see in everyday life which is also the same reason why I love stuff like Two Towers and Silent Hill Way before todays modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic CGI to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place One of my favorite shots in Two Towers is the one where we see the trolls opening the Black Gates the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor and thats what I love about the Genie and other creatures in the movie Theyre just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though theyre all just fantasy beingsbr br Its literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of Aladdin got their inspiration The characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative Genie right down to the flying carpet Its not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since its nice to know that Im not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie I first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week I still think its amazing Thats a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time Sure the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40s so give it a break Not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under todays standardbr br If you ever wanted to see a live action version of Aladdin then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this wont be their cup of tea
1	Theres so many things to fall for in Aro Tolbukhin En la mente del asesino Inside the killers mind that its very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning Lets just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really really great done It´s made with super 8 black and white shots 35 milimeters color interviews flashbacks Aro Tolbukhin it´s like a movie made a documental or viceversa which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering did he really ever existed The movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in Guatemala worked in a religious mission and then killed some people An act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced The movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death Nowadays some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character The one we are witness of the moviebr br For the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside Aro´s mind mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done Nevertheless the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions we clearly never justify them So the first half is based upon recollecting information later things turn into Aros childhood giving the movie such an incredible new force even tough never got weak or boringbr br I dont mean and dont want to spoil anything so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you believe me the trip to see it is more than worthy
1	This is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all Generally speaking I am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories And this one is GREAT Besides Meryls performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise the movies greatest asset is the story it is based on The riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eyeopening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society It is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people the emotional jury ladies in the movie for example are in reality nothing more than selfish dupes who would for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices shut their brains to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts pointing very clearly against their opinions The other face of the socalled civilized society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings needless to say this is very general even though this specific tale unfolds in Australia that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty Must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thoughtprovoking
1	This series is set a year after the mission to Abydos in the movie Stargate It explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention Such as how was the Stargate activated without a human computer Where did the Goauld Ras race come from How many are there br br The first episode has a retired Jack ONeill spelled with 2 Ls recalled to active duty by General George Hammond due to an attack by the shut down Stargate from Apophis a powerful Goauld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman We meet Samantha Carter a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the Stargate the first time and is determined to go through now We find out that Daniel got married on Abydos and that there are hundreds of Gate addresses that they can dial Then Daniels wife gets captured by Apophis and becomes his new queen br br It continues in the second episode where General Hammond announces the formation of the SGC which includes nine teams in which Jacks team will be SG1 which consists of Jack Samantha and Daniel They go to Chulak a Goauld homeworld to rescue Daniels wife and another one captured at Abydos named Skara They get captured and just as Apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners a Jaffa named Tealc First Prime of Apophis saves them and goes to Earth with them where he is made part of SG1 br br That was only the beginning of the adventure In the course of the show they have gone to the past and future gotten transported to alternate realities swapped bodies grown old met alien races which include a rebel alliance of Goauld called the Tokra in which Samanthas Dad becomes a member the Asgard a cute little race in which we see Thor most often hes Jacks buddyand avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless timesbr br The show was recently canceled but lasted ten seasons In season nine a new enemy called the Ori came in flaunting brand new powers new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the Stargate and its creators the Ancients Season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters Ben Browder as Cameron Mitchell the new leader of SG1 and Claudia Black as Vala MalDoran a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team br br Very wellproduced interesting characters fantastic Special effects and a subtle love interest between Samantha and Jack this one has it all A different way of travelling the galaxy and different kinds of adventures this is one show you dont want to miss Unlock the gate and step through You wont regret it

0	and you can look at that statement in different ways by the way First of all its a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes Your wildest imagination doesnt even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here Entire parts of this movie are just plain sick disgusting offensive brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out Now I love horror movies and I am very proviolence but I do think that it has to lead somewhere Is that too much to ask Cradle of Fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts The movie contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story This results in endless showing of torture murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common Not very informative if you ask me And yet it has to be said the basic plot idea surely HAS potential Its about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial Personally I think that is an interesting topic so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie everbr br Secondly the whole production of this movie was a mess They didnt have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and gutsTons of it The acting performances are a joke and some of the worst Ive ever seen Any other special effects besides the makeup looks very amateurish Like that attempt to a realistic car crash for example Theres no tension or atmosphere to detect anywherenot even an attempt to build up onebr br Cradle of Fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least With the presence of deathmetal icon Danni Filth from the band Cradle of filthget the link this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial Troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this And then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasingBah I can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when youre easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind For every selfrespecting horror fan this movie is an insult
1	SPOILERS Many different comedy series nowadays have at one point or another experimented with the idea of obscure independence In an early episode of cartoon Family Guy the Griffin family find their home is an independent nation to the United States of America and the story progresses from there Way back in 1949 however the Ealing Studios produced a wonderful little film along the same ideabr br After a childs prank the residents of Pimlico discover a small fortune in treasure At the inquest it becomes clear that the small area is a small outcrop of the long lost state of Burgundy Withdrawing from London and the rest of Great Britain the residents of the small street experience the joys and the problems with being an independent statebr br Based at a time when rationing was still in operation this story is brilliantly told and equally inspiring Featuring performances by Stanley Holloway Betty Warren Philip Stainton and a young Charles Hawtrey the film is well stocked with some of the finest actors of their generation These actors are well aided as well by a superb little script with some cracking lines Feeling remarkably fresh despite being over 50 years old the story never feels awkward and always keeps the audience entertainedbr br Ealing Studios was one of the finest exporters of British film ever in existence With films like Passport to Pimlico its not difficult to see why Amusing from start to finish the story is always fun and always worth watching
0	I do regret that I have bought this series I expected more action more objective picture and more consistency This is just a pure propaganda series very dark without any charm or romanticism it is just boredom itself I find the actors work quite weak as well ODonnell might seem charming as Robin with Batman but in this picture he lacks any charm Probably while he becomes older he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up It comes as no surprise that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the UK for 40 of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands
1	Meryl Streep is such a genius Well at least as an actress I know shes been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents but she nails the accent every time Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring Mrs Chamberlain as portrayed here was not particularly likable nor all that smart But that just makes Streeps work all the more remarkable I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Oscar nominations About the film well there were a couple of interesting things I dont know much about Australia but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story I had largely missed this when I first saw the film some years ago but it came through loud and clear yesterday And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at miseryinducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues A pretty good film A bit different Grade B
0	Maybe Im missing something because Ive read more positive things about The Man Who Cheated Himself than I have read bad reviews and I just dont get it I like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak look and act like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura None of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it Take the lead actor Lee J Cobb His rumpled rolledoutofbed look is about as far from the dashing smoothtalking noir archetype as youll find Or take Jane Wyatt as the femme fatale as another example This is one of the worst cases of miscasting Ive seen in a while Shes just not convincing in the rolebr br As for the plot its tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre I could have predicted the outcome of The Man Who Cheated Himself after about five minutes And that final catandmouse chase scene is plain old dull Ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it
0	The Wrinkle in Time book series is my favorite series from childhood I have read and reread them more times than I can count over the last 35 years The characters with all their virtues and flaws are near and dear to my heart This adaptation contained very little of the wonderful magical spiritual story that I love so much To say I was disappointed with this film would be a great understatementbr br If you have never read the books I imagine you will enjoy the movie The acting is passable the special effects are well done for a made for TV movie and the story is interesting However if you love the books avoid this movie at all costsbr br I found this statement at the Wikipedia page of the novel In an interview with Newsweek LEngle said of the film I expected it to be bad and it isbr br I like another reviewer here feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind
0	Worst movie I have seen since Gingerale Afternoon I suppose that this is a horrorcomedy I pretty much predicted every scene in this movie The specialeffects were not so special I believe that I could come up with as good of effects from what I have lying around the house I wish I could have something good to say about this movie but I am afraid that I dont Even Coolio should be ashamed of appearing in such a turkey I do after a little thought have one thing good to say about this movie it ended
0	It appears that many critics find the idea of a Woody Allen drama unpalatable And for good reason they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of Bergman And lets not kid ourselves critics were mostly supportive of Allens Bergman pretensions Allens whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding What I dont get is this why was Allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating Bergman but the contemporaneous Brian DePalma was excoriated for ripping off Hitchcock in his suspensehorror films In Robin Woods view its a strange form of cultural snobbery I would have to agree with that
1	Footlight Parade is among the best of the 1930s musical comedy extravaganzas A snappy script and an allstar cast including Jimmy Cagney the lovely Joan Blondell Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler make this film a cut above the rest Directed and choreographed by the creative genius Busby Berkeley this film will have you grinning from eartoear from start to finishbr br Busby of course is the undisputed master of the Hollywood musical with Gold Diggers of 1933 and 42nd Street to his credit as Dance Director Footlight Parade is graced by hundreds of scantilyclad chorus girls a Berkeley trademark The elaborate dance numbers were shot with only one camera and Busby was the first director to film closeups of the dancers His obsession with shapely legs and rearview shots is amply demonstrated here The overall effect is highly erotic and mesmerizingbr br Our boy Jimmy Cagney plays Chester Kent a producer of prologues or short musical stage productions that were performed in movie theaters to entertain the audience before the talkies were shown Hes surrounded by crooked partners a corporate spy and a golddigging girlfriend Although Cagney had a solid background in vaudeville this was the first film in which he showed his dancing talents Joan Blondell is memorable as Cagneys wisecracking lovestruck secretary And Ruby Keeler is adorable as alwaysbr br The film climaxes with three outstanding production numbers Honeymoon Hotel The Waterfall and Shanghai Lil each one a masterpiece and not likely to be duplicated in todays Hollywood where socalled special effects have replaced creative cinematographybr br Claudias Bottom Line Clever and erotic with some of the best musical production numbers ever put on celluloid A thoroughly enjoyable Depression era romp
1	Im watching this on the Star World network overseas which buys American and Canadian series that last one or two seasons like The Jane Show I thought of how many female lead comedy shows Im actually able to watch on my own Theres Lucy Bewitched I Dream Of Jeanie the one with Barbara Feldman and then my mind goes kind of blank I cannot think of any others the women are all supporting roles not the lead So for me The Jane Show is in pretty good company One thing I just thought of though Ive watched several things made in Canada and I never recall any thing being filmed in a regular TV series that shows SNOW Its all made at the height of summer LOL Granted its a great place to live climate wise in the summer but you would THINK they would show a little bit of Canada in the winter since thats part of the lifestyle there also I mean SCTV Just For Laughs come to mind as two comedy shows that lasted a long time filmed in Canada and very little or none is shot with snow present even though they both do a lot of outdoor shots I digress but I kind of chuckle at Jane and her obviously liberal ways being accused of racism to her neighbor and I like the bald guy and his craziness I found it on par with a UK series called The IT Crowd I Think another office comedy with a female lead Not by any means the best comedy ever but for a guy to say he can watch it alone thats saying something If I was with my wife she might really enjoy it since it addresses sex in the office and stuff like that so might be a good light comedy for couples to watch 7 of 10
1	Adolf Hitlers maniacal desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven part series of films produced by the US War Department as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering the Armed Forces during World War II Hitlers plan was methodical and well conceived starting with the conquest of Eastern Europe expanding to the European heartland then moving on to the World Island consisting of Europe Asia and Africa His final move would be to reach across the oceans for the ultimate conquest of the Americas and the Worldbr br In 1935 Hitler ordered national conscription as the rest of the country fell under his evil spell Grade school children sang his praises and young German boys received training and indoctrination in military camps Marching unopposed into Austria in 1938 Hitler followed by annexing a strip of land bordering Germany and Czechoslovakia called Sudetenland In 1939 Hitler took all of Czechoslovakia Later in the year the world was stunned to learn that Germany signed a nonaggression pact with its mortal enemy Russia a ploy to delay Hitlers military involvement on too many fronts Immediately after Germany invaded Poland bringing Hitlers conquest right to Russias doorstep He would deal with her laterbr br It was during this period that Britain still declined to oppose Hitlers thrust across Europe Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain felt he procured a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with Germany his infamous declaration stating Peace in Our Time It didnt turn out that waybr br The most fascinating information to be learned in this installment at least to me was provided by a small snippet of footage from a German pro Hitler rally in the mid 30s It was led by a German American taking his cue directly from the homeland The venue Madison Square Garden
0	This movie was okay but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are born that way especially when a woman can exit out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman It almost seems as if Kates gender preferences turned on and off like a switch making this film seem a little simplisticbr br Also as is common with films that are trying to push an agenda it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval over the gay lifestyle were labeled as bigots And there was no happy medium It was either Kates friends and relatives totally embraced her or they totally shunned her This is not typical of interactions between gay and nongay relatives and friends It is usually a mixture of emotions and values that come into play It is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily condoning the choices they make Sadly the movie showed none of these types of interactions For a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance it struck me as very intolerant movie Then at the end Kate apparently decides after all these years she wants to be with Mac and everything is hunky dory is that what being gay is really all about Come on

1	Like a lot of series pilots Dark Angels opener shows a mixture of great potential and a slight problem finding its own feet Not that this is unusual in any way but there is a feeling that it could have worked better if the story was tightened and focused a little more In todays world where something has to catch on instantly or face cancellation the series did itself a bit of a disservice by not coming out at least halfway focused with all guns blazingbr br The ninetyminute pilot really feels like two episodes glued together and both episodes have a problem with focus In the first half we are introduced to Max and filled in on what drives her We also get a few interesting routines with Max using her abilities to win bets interacting with a PI or sorting out coworkers domestic problems The problem here is that this is nothing out of the ordinary for any human being with a normal set of genes on television or otherwisebr br Its when we hit the second half that we get a story with a purpose and focus Throughout the two halves Max finds herself the focus of attention from a pirate journalist who feels it is mission in life to save the world by exposing one dirty dealer at a time In the second half the repercussions catch up with him and Max reluctantly cleans up the resulting mess This sets up the premise for the entire rest of the series and it works but it doesnt quite click if you get my meaning Its like most of the pieces are there but a couple that make a complete image have been left out Perhaps they get filled in with later episodes but thats beside the point The fact is that the contents of this episode could easily have been told with twentyeight less minutesbr br The last of the negatives is that a lot of the support cast are totally unendearing Original Cindy in particular is an annoyance and I doubt that changed during the next twenty episodes While the acting isnt as bad as daytime soap it isnt of such quality that Id commend it Jessica Alba is not the worst actor in the world but she does come up short in terms of being convincing when the story needs it leastbr br The good news is that the premise and the production values are all topnotch In fact this series was considered quite expensive to produce and it is quite unfortunate that it was cancelled in order to be replaced by another show that didnt last a whole season Especially when there was ample time for both shows they could have simply cancelled one of the pieces of disingenious garbage they flog under the banner of reality TV The fact is that we need more shows like Dark Angel where imagination rather than overhype are used to draw the attentionbr br In all I gave the Dark Angel pilot a seven out of ten It never rises above the level of throwaway television and it never got a chance to live up to the potential it shows within its own running time But the potential is there and thats often all that matters where pilots are concerned
0	I chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on IMDb But a lot of people either have really poor taste or someones been fixing the scorebr br Either way it was a real disappointment The movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest There really is no reason to give a summary of the plot but here goes it felt like someone had been thinking Wouldnt it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane And then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff And thats about it The plot is thin and unoriginal The snakes are bad CGI but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone The acting is poor and all people are unbelievable stereo typesbr br To sum it up Its one of the worst movies Ive ever seen stay away
0	When I was little my parents took me along to the theater to see Interiors It was one of many movies I watched with my parents but this was the only one we walked out of Since then I had never seen Interiors until just recently and I could have lived out the rest of my life without it What a pretentious ponderous and painfully boring piece of 70s wine and cheese tripe Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors but Interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career In the unmistakable style of Ingmar Berman Allen gives us a dark angular muted insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce estrangement career love nonlove halitosis whatever The film intentionally has no comic relief no music and is drenched in shadowy pathos This film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a more pronounced depth of meaning and truth But Woody Allen is no Ingmar Bergman The film is painfully slow and dull But beyond that I simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters Instead I felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling whining nicotine stained martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity Amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked Brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room Everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes Everyone is lost and struggling desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them Its never about resolution its only about interminable introspective babble It is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audiences ability to connect Woody Allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out And for that reason I found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining I see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through Prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance I highly recommend this one if youre feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death Otherwise lets just pretend this film never happened
1	The makers have chosen the best people for the job and set the scene wonderfully Every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it Whether the period is the 20s the first story the present ie 1950 for the middle story or the 1910s the last costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created I love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium exquisite lace overlaid by the finest Shetland shawls Roland Culver as Ashenden is very appealing but never mind the soppy young lovers its Raymond Huntley as the man who resents his wifes health and independence who harrows our emotions He usually played comical pompous types but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive The China Seas great 30s film starring Gable and Harlow stole the plot from the Mr Know All episode and also nicked a story by Kipling I wish we saw more of Naunton Wayne as the jealous husband though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a Mexican hat I love that posh bird who plays his wife too
1	Emma was a product of what might be called by the First Great Jane Austen Cycle of the midnineties and it was recently shown on British television doubtless because of the interest in the author created by the Second Great Jane Austen Cycle which started with Pride and Prejudice two years ago We currently have in the cinemas the Austen biopic Becoming Jane and ITV have recently produced three TV movies based on Austen novels These include Northanger Abbey the only one of the six major novels not to have been filmed previously so the cycle should now be complete No doubt however there will be more to come in the near future There is after all her juvenile Love and Freindship sic the short novella Lady Susan and someone somewhere has doubtless supplied endings to her two unfinished fragments The Watsons and Sanditon Then there are all those Austen sequels churned out by modern writers br br The main character is Emma Woodhouse a young lady from an aristocratic family in Regency England Not as some reviewers have assumed Victorian England Austen died before Queen Victoria was even born Emma is financially considerably better off than most Austen heroines such as Elizabeth Bennett or Fanny Price and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband Instead her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends She persuades her friend Harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer Robert Martin believing that Harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman Mr Elton This scheme goes disastrously wrong however as Elton has no interest in Harriet but has fallen in love with Emma herself The speed with which Emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards with good reason as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself This being a Jane Austen plot Emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems and she too finds herself falling in love leading to further complicationsbr br Emma always insists that she will not marry without affection and when she does find a partner the handsome Mr Knightley we feel that this will indeed be an affectionate marriage It does not however seem likely to be a very passionate one unlike say that of Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy Knightley who is sixteen years older than Emma she is 21 he 37 and related to her by marriage is more like a fatherfigure than a lover Much more of a fatherfigure in fact than her actual father a querulous and selfish old hypochondriac who seems more like her grandfather When Emma is rude to her unbearably garrulous and tedious friend Miss Bates it is Knightley who chides her for her lack of manners His surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature nineteenthcentury gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry Both Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam play their parts very well but this is not really one of the great screen romancesbr br Of the other characters I liked Juliet Stephensons vulgar Mrs Elton and Toni Collettes Harriet I know that in the novel Harriet was a naïve young teenager whereas here she is more like the character Collette played in Muriels Wedding a gauche slightly overweight twentysomething fretting about her chances of finding a man Nevertheless I felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the film and did not detract from Austens themesbr br Emma is one of Austens more lighthearted works without the darker overtones of Mansfield Park or even Pride and Prejudice and this is reflected on screen We see a world of beauty and grace full of stately homes and elegant costumes and fine manners Apart from the ruffianly gypsies who make a very brief appearance the only poor people we see are Mrs Bates and her daughter and as they live in the sort of picturesque rosestrewn thatched cottage which today would change hands for over £500000 we can be sure that their poverty is relative not absolute In Emmas world poverty is defined as not having your own stately home This is of course not a comprehensive picture of early nineteenthcentury life but nobody has ever claimed Austen as the Regency equivalent of a kitchensink realist Sophisticated romantic comedy combined with a keen eye for analysing human character was more in her linebr br I would not rate this film quite as highly as the 1994 Sense and Sensibility or the recent Pride and Prejudice it tends to drag a bit in the middle although it has a strong beginning and strong ending but it is in the main a highly enjoyable Austen adaptation 710
1	I saw this movie being a Jane Austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels well this transposition is simply accurate intelligent delicate careful tactful respectful intense in a word perfectbr br Emma is one of Austens most delightful and funny novels thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters The movie respected this subtle irony not disregarding the comic element Miss Bates above all What engaged me in the novel and the movie renders it clearly is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the English novelist and the modern look with which women men and their relation are handled and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the 18th century who lived almost a secluded life could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did that most and still fascinates me We can feel this modernity throughout the movie just replace costumes and use a more current language but the situations the feelings the ideas would be extremely modern I think of the morbid interest in other peoples lives or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule womens relations and still the difficulty in revealing and giving expression to ones feelings especially love every situation gets a universal and outoftime value br br The cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances a young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suitable for this role nowadays she would be probably too mature for it Toni Colette is simply great And how I envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear And then the breathtaking English countryside where every situation gets such a magic and dreamlike dimension a really enjoyable and deserving movie
1	This movie was made in 1948 but it still rings true today Very very funny It begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it builds from there Anyone who has ever built a house will find this movie very endearing Great cast Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delightful in this film This is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40sclothing architecture and family life Many references are made to the cost of things and those comparisons to todays costs are pretty amazing I cant imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely I am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it A true classic
0	Warning This review contains minor spoilersbr br Well the writers of the first Tremors are officially out of ideas Im a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare Tremors 4 The Legends Begins however is a very dull movie Where the heck are the Graboids br br Due to the relative lack of Graboids through the first 90 minutes Im convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a character study Unfortunately there isnt one interesting character in the movie except for Billy Dragos character who is given too few lines too little to do and in the end too little screen time What saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer Whenever there wasnt any action on the screen you could rest assured that Burt Gummer was going to be interesting to listen too andor watch However in this movie Gross plays Hiram Gummer a very poor and boring substitute br br On the plus side when the Graboids Dirt Dragons in this movie are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it getsbr br I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long Pretty good for straight to video But after watching it Im sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long There are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesnt further the plot any Was there a rush to get this movie made I think not more time could have and should have been spent on the scriptbr br I thought I had hit a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 packaged for sale withTremors What luck I thought pay for 4 get 1 for free Well after watching Tremors 4 I like to think I paid for the original and got this mess for free I cant imagine paying a single dime for Tremors 4 For fans of the series its best to forget that Tremors 4 The Legend Begins even existsbr br Tremors 4 The Legend Begins rates a 3 out of 10

0	SPOILER ALERT In this generic and forgettable action movie Lorenzo Lamas does his usual tough guypretty boy act and his future real life ex Kathleen Kinmont is ass kicking hot chick Alexa OJ Simpson is a detective coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona Translation cable TV filler There isnt enough skin to qualify this as a Guilty Pleasurebr br The script has some gaping holes BestWorst Moment In one jarring scene OJs partner expresses his aversion to the morgue OJ responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot or words to that effect This vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released it is truly appalling and therefore entertaining in an unintentional horrible way I was so startled that I laughed until champagne came out of my nose Now THATS a Guilty Pleasure BC
0	Raising Victor Vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be being real Unfortunately there is no reality to this film The characters and situations feel completely artificial and fakebr br The reason Bad directing Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal It seems Mr Sollett read somewhere that not lighting his film would give it an authentic feel Wrong It just gives it a badlymade feel Similarly shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from whats on screen instead of enhance itbr br Of course whats on screen is so painfully fake as if Mr Sollett wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look hip to his Sundance buddies and show how edgy a filmmaker he isbr br Overall the only lasting impression this film leaves you with is what a bad director Mr Sollett is Next time how about taking a few writing and directing classes
1	Im a big fan of films where people get conned and House of Games is almost the pinnacle of the films where people get conned genre In short its an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels and never truly revealing whats happening while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what youve just seen The film cons the audience on many occasions and despite us knowing this its still difficult to guess where its going and every twist comes off as a surprise As mentioned Im a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler She then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a conbr br House of Games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout and David Mamet does well in establishing his films setting in the underground levels of the city The film is well acted also with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill Joe Mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film and although his performance is a little under wrought hes always solid and believable as the villain of the piece Lindsay Crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work and again is believable in her role She may not be the greatest looker but at least she can act The way that the film executes its plot is the main star of the show however and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer At times its almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film Another thing thats great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons which is useful if youre interested in making twenty bucks say All in all House of Games is a truly first rate thrill ride
0	This ranks as one of the worst movies Ive seen in years Besides Cuba and Angie the acting is actually embarrassing Wasnt Archer once a decent actress What happened to her The action is decent but completely implausible The make up is so bad its worth mentioning I mean who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film Someone should tell the make up artist and the DOP that youre not supposed to actually see it The ending is a massive disappointment along the lines of and then they realized it was all a dreambr br Dont waste your time or your money Youre better off just staring into space for 2 hours
1	This is probably Karisma at her best apart from Zubeidaa Nana Patekar also gives out his best without even trying The story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag especially when Shahrukh comes in the picture What really made me like it were the performances of the leads the dialog delivery as well as the story for what it was It couldve been directed better and edited The supporting case was even great including Karimas mother in law even though she just had one shining moment it was great to watch herbr br The sets were also pretty good I didnt really like their portrayal of a Canadian family but once they step in India its as real as it getsbr br Overall I would give it a thumbs up
0	Now Im one to watch movies that got poor reviews and say Hmm this isnt so bad I loved The Cable Guy and thought that My Big Fat Independent Movie was great Keep in mind I really didnt start watching this with high hopes but I figured that maybe just maybe it would be bad in a kind of way I could laugh at it I was wrong At no point at all during my suffering through this film And I use that term sparingly was I even close to being mildly entertained To start Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting I hate rap music but as far as I could tell an Amish priest would probably make a better rapper than him The main character is simply annoying and not a character that its easy to like Quite frankly I would rather eat a greasy turd out of a Harlequin fetus bloody sores than watch this again
0	BTK Killer Green River Killer Zodiac Killer the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is he loves his crapbr br Ive never seen a Ulli Lommel film but I was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful Like the movies I said in the beginning dont even equal a six when added together After reading the comments I was curious to see how bad this guy really is He is the worst out therebr br The credits wouldnt end as the pathetic movie started and quickly I noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in The acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots The editing is easily the worst This movie made no sense and I unbearably couldnt take it anymore as it wouldnt end and I was only 45 minutes in the movie I couldnt take it anymore I wasted 45 minutes of my lifebr br DO NOT WATCH THIS CRAP
1	Actually my vote is a 75 Anyway the movie was good it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it dont misunderstand me is not the funniest movie of the world and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies but this one has its own taste a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends I think that not exactly but who cares Also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic Chris Rock appears in it the name is Down to Earth men that one its a very funny movie see both if you want and I know that you will agree that Mr Rock won with his movie I would liked that the protagonist male character were given to Ashton Kutcher however the film is good
0	The 1930s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world with an emphasis on wild animals exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures Despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place and then bringing em back alive with the film footage such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional Hollywood features because there were no expensive sets costumes or highpriced movie starsbr br The most successful makers of such films artistically and financially were the team of Martin E Johnson and his wife Osa who made several documentaries sometimes with blatantly staged events in Africa and Asia The Johnsons safari films were extremely popular inspiring several parodies most notably Wheeler Woolseys So This is Africa in which the very sexy Esther Muir plays a character named Mrs JohnsonMartini instead of Martin E Johnson geddit Although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time the Johnsons films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour Viewed from our own more enlightened I hope standpoint this is a serious flaw in the Johnsons documentaries there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana Johnson and his wifebr br One definite asset of these movies is the presence of Osa Johnson Ten years younger than her husband she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter While certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond Esther Muir Osa Johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she coproduced with her husbandbr br Congorilla is probably the best of the Johnsons films The shots of the Congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in 1930 The shots of the Pygmies and other natives are also interesting although these suffer from the Johnsons penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look wild and alienbr br The best and funniest scene in Congorilla is an improvised sequence in which Osa Johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some Pygmy women The dance is the Black Bottom no less the same dance which Bob Hope famously taught to Daisy and Violet Hilton the conjoined twins Wearing jodhpurs riding boots and a pith helmet Osa Johnson starts scatsinging while she does high steps and slaps her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the African women Meanwhile they just stand there staring at her apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish Its a very funny scene but it has unpleasant undertones Osa Johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black Americans the implication seems to be that black Africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration using natural rhythm I guess because its in their blood or somethingbr br Ill rate Congorilla 4 points out of 10 This film says a little bit about African life in the 1930s and rather more about American cultural perceptions in that same decade
0	ITS THIS ONE Very cool premise right off the batbr br Has an excellent first scene gotta give credit where credits duebr br Has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me Whenever the ghosts appeared which I really liked by the way how it was done how it lookedthe only thing was the ghosts relationship Because of the way things went down in the first scene youd think their dynamic would be differentbr br Things slowed down a little too much in the middle I felt and the crabspider scene was just not good BUT then the ending is actually very good Sure The Grudge basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurais and thats what I liked about this movie comparativelybr br Please someone one with a tempered style remake this moviebr br Fans of Silent Rage would absolutely love this movie
0	I had some expectation for the movie since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of Akshay and Saif Well I was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2 but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan I would say Dhoom 2 is very realistic br br When I saw the credits at the beginning I felt nice because it was put up in a nice way Well the very first scene itself pised me off Then the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences Me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights It was like Akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns Phewyou got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences arebr br The other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story It reminded me of some of the early 80s moviesbr br Well the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy Kareena who looked really hot in this oneAnd for that I give a rating of 2 out of 10br br Guys pleasepleasedont see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie Well you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenesbr br Thats all
0	This could have been interesting  a Japanset haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newlyinstalled American family  but falls flat due to an oversimplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and directorbr br The film suffers from the same problem I often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare ie the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that theyre expected to Besides it doesnt deliver much in the scares department  a giant crab attack is merely silly  as generally the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way such as Susan George seducing diplomatfriendofthefamily Doug McClure and Edward Albert forcefeeding his daughter a bowl of soup br br At one point an old monk turns up at the house to warn Albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually hes called upon to exorcise the premises However history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created  leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which Albert and McClure possessed by the spirits of their Japanese predecessors engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death At the end of the day this emerges an innocuous timewaster  tolerable at just 88 minutes but in no way essential viewing
0	With this film Bunuel manipulates the viewer with all of films might while stating clearly in the film that his work is one of objectivity Obviously it is not For one reason many scenes shot by pure chance are obvious setups when that poor goat accidently falls off the cliff you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen For another his concealing of one important information the Hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film That is goitre a sickness caused by lack of iodine salt This goitre is the cause of their cretinism and had Bunuel only took the time to make his research heck if he checked cretinism in a medical dictionary hed have found goitre he MIGHT have ended up telling the truth about these people still doubtfully Instead with his film he judges them constantly talking about them as cretins again and again dramatizing the action settingup scenes to create the spectacle all of this very unacceptable for a documentarist which claims to work for an allmighty objectivity Bunuel talks all the time in this film not letting one word to the people he is filming He talks FOR them and even then JUDGES them This piece is flawed to its roots to its ideology and its a real shame its considered a great film
1	This show is so full of action and everything needed to make an awsome show but best of all it actually has a plot unlike some of those new reality shows It is about a transgenic girl who escapes from her military holding base I totally suggest bying the DVDs ive already preordered them i suggest you do to
0	Totally ridiculous If you know anything about poker you will find it absolutely appalling but also entertaining because it is so clueless The nerd who made this movie is obviously very religious and knows slightly about the game of poker but I doubt hes ever played above 36 I think he also knows nothing of golf Where to start Ive seen better productions in the Intro to Film class I took freshmen year of film school The actors to watch in this movie are Queen Momma Scotty Nguyen and the loser who can never win at poker Everyone else is as wooden as they come like bad porn actorsbr br Spoiler The man the movie starts with in the opening sequence is the only reason the film got made He is a railbird who doesnt play poker and never has a line of dialogue but the actor is the man who obviously paid for the movie I cant think of a more useless waste of money than this man shelling out for this pointless production Its fitting that he had such a useless rolebr br Theres very little poker in this movie Most of the time is spent on useless side characters whose plots arent resolved in the slightest Queen Momma does have a showstealing scene where she throws her loser boyfriend through a window and tries to shoot his brains out Also the nameless Arabs in the convenience store also give brilliant performances when they debate whether to beat up or kill an older lady who robs them Their subtle performances are easily among the films highlights It makes you wonder why they bothered getting all these white people to play the leadsbr br In conclusion complete nonsense Plan 9 from Outer Space has slightly more coherency If you play poker though you might want to have a laugh Also if youre Christian you might enjoy some of the heavyhanded religious conversation that pepper the movie like pointless pepper I hate movies made by religious people Especially ones who think they know something about things they know nothing about Its sad that Jennifer Harman and Scotty Nguyen got involved in this travesty as I cant help but think less of them They must be envious of Johnny Chan for getting in Rounders
1	Shinjuku Triad Society albeit from perfect is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uberconventional realm Its a yakuzatriad picture involving cops versus Japanese or Chinese gangsters mostly Chinese as the title suggests but already even in his first technical debut Takashi Miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from hereon in Social issues like black market trading of precious goods in this case human organs usually from children nostalgia for childhood and ones roots which was especially prevalent in Dead or Alive 2 thumbingofthenose at taboos like gay sex and satirical rapeviolence towards women bloodcurdling violence Its certainly not as surreal as some of Miikes most recent films but this is expected as hes trying out things that hes just starting to learn following a track record of straight to video programmers Its got all of those qualities and its also like the films that would follow from it equally savage and heartfelt crazy in spots and sardonic in its drama and solid for genre fansbr br The story concerns two brothers one a Chinese orphan raised in Japan Tatsuhito Kiriya Kippei Shiina pretty decent as a Eastwoodesquire antiherohero whos become a detective and another whos become a gangster or a wouldbe one The main arch likely takeover gang comes from Wang a definite pun on what the gang represents during its sparetime played by Tomorowo Taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes and his partner Karino Takeshi Caesar whos threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman whos just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a Miike movie Theres some intrigue involving the organtrading scheme with the gangsters which Kiriya almost becomes a victim of and the gangs penchant for gay sex at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want It all leads up to vengeance and redemption qualities that Miike and his writer are trying to emulate from Shakespeare hence the Macbeth bit with Wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying it wont come offbr br If it doesnt add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great Shakespeare play would have its par for the course of a film like this Miikes goals are met though just met in his lowscale ambitions a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime and what the realm of unrepentant sex with both sexes brings out psychologically in the characters At the same time Shinjuku Triad Society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting blackcomedy from the Miike oeuvre Some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face or the randomness of the interrogation as it goes into a very twisted area Theres even a laughoutloud line from the young sexslave after finishing an act on one of the bosses Thank you Mr WeenyBurger Miike and his writer dont have enough here to make the film a fullon dark comedy like Ichi or of course Visitor Q but theres enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and charactersbr br As the first entry of the Black Society trilogy as its called I was quite impressed and its a fine quasicalling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema
0	The last Tarzan film starring Johnny Weissmuller looking surprisingly aged a year after Tarzan and the Huntress is bad in spite of all the trivia one can add to make it look better It is obvious that RKO tried to make a great farewell for Weissmuller shooting in beautiful scenery in México with a top star of that country Andrea Palma and multiple awardwinning cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa and bringing in prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin to do the score Although it may have cost less for filming abroad it looks more expensive than any other RKO film in the series taking advantage of Acapulco beaches and real pyramids as Aquatania and with impressive décors for all the scenes related to the temple of god Balu especially the exterior built on steep rocks Kurt Neumann should have stayed as director instead of Robert Florey who gives it a very slow pace Neumann had done a fine work with Tarzan and the Amazons Tarzan and the Leopard Woman and Tarzan and the Huntress and finished his career directing the classic The Fly the year before his death while Florey became a television director after a career of few remarkable films If Weissmuller looks tired the chimp playing Cheeta is not as good as the others but the worst character is Benji an obnoxious mailman who sings horrendous songs that have a Caribbean air in a location supposed to be Africa and shot in México Boring and decidedly of dubious taste it was a sad farewell to Weissmullers Tarzan
1	For all of you that dont speak swedish The swedish original title of this film Rånarna translates into something in the line of The Robbers This fact is the main problem I have with the film cause its not really about the robbers at all Its about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies A regular desk job one would think but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands as the story goes even shooting one of the robbers Exactly Weve seen this before The fact that theres a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesnt really help as the ending is just as cliché as the first two thirds of the filmbr br What saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that its masterfully executed in all ways that the actors are as great as they are and dont overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the storybr br One thing that I really loved about this film is the fact that its music sets the right mood when its needed but is absent for the rest of the time which gives a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and carchases spread throughout the film A nice touch The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film as you know that hes not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background but thats something you have to neglectbr br All in all its an entertaining film that steals more money in its plot than time from you 710
0	so its really sexist and classist and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change well he certainly changed his tune and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers the end of the movie does not make her a hero it makes the whole thing sad and its sad that people think it makes her a hero perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience yuck

0	A splendid example of how Hollywood could and still can take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it upbr br In the case of the Big Sky writer Dudley Nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the Pulitzer prizewinning author AB Guthrie In so doing they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptationbr br The epic nature of Guthries book and the evolution of its main character Boone Caudill from a naive Kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivormountain man has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the authors intent In the movie version Boones presence is nothing except underwhelmingbr br Intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give Guthries novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever Most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the Zeb Calloway character who was an incidental minor character in the book only occupying a handful of pages On the other hand a very important and fascinating character Dick Summers the veteran pioneer is missing altogether It is also apparent that director Hawks decided the Zeb character in the movie played by actor Hunnicutt wasnt irritating enough So ZebHunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious voiceover narration that is the Hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing editing and directionbr br Some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based William Wylers BenHur is an excellent example But this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itselfbr br The story is dull and clichéd and the characters at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script are just shallow and boring shadows of Guthries literary vision And unfortunately Kirk Douglas star appeal which could have helped lift this film was scuttled by the milktoast role he was givenbr br If you can believe it the film version of Guthries Pulitzer prizewinning sequel The Way West also starring Kirk is even worsebr br In my opinion The Big Sky further solidifies Howard Hawks place as one of the most overrated tepid directors in the history of cinema
1	Most people miss Hollywoods point of concept If a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child within the confines of the law then I approve of the lessons being taught by Doc Savagebr br In all times of conflict or war the public and government look for heroes to decorate The motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with such as Doc Savage James Bond Superman Batman Spiderman and others Doc Savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the best of the best before James Bond Superman or any of the others All others that follow Doc Savage are only a part of the character not the Man of Bronze
1	A magical journey concocted by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell These two TITANS of the British cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece Some of the most ravishing early Technicolor a SUBLIME and shimmering Miklos Rozsa musical score along with the youthful exuberance of Sabu the theatrical and malevolent villainy of Conrad Veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of June Duprez as the princess all work wonderfully well Miles Malleson who plays Duprez father the Sultan of Basra also wrote the perfect screenplay which is appropriately grandiose DONT MISS THIS ONE Since posting the above comments I have obtained the recently released DVD and can honestly say Id never seen the picture properly until viewing this DVD versionThe clarity and resolution is so precise and the colors are so vivid that I was stunnedThis amazing classic can be watched time an again and never fails to charm and delight the viewer Again A MUST SEE
0	I cant tell you how angry I was after seing this movie The characters are not the slightest bit interesting and the plot is nonexistant So after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other hoping that the past 2 and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish what do we get A storm of frogs Now yes I understand the references to the bible Exodus and the underlying theme but first of all it was presented with absolutely no resolution and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible a significant portion of the population or Charles Fort a still larger portion As a somewhat well read person I thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episodebr br Dont waste your time It would be better spent readingbr br well anything to be honest
0	well the writing was very sloppy the directing was sloppier and the editing made it worse at least i hope it was the editing the acting wasnt bad but it wasnt that good either pretty much none of the characters were likable at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential it was a great idea but yet another wasted good idea goes by it could have ended 3 different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending and what wasnt predictable was done so badly that it didnt matter the ending was not worth watching at all sandra bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies the movie looked rushed also the movie just wasnt really worth seeing and had i paid for it i would have been very mad maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one the movie over all was not horrifibly bad but i wouldnt reccomend it i gave it 2 out of 10 bc i liked the idea so much and i did like one character justin i believe the super smart one and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape it was not pretty anyway if you see it wait for the 150 theater or video unless you like pretty much every movie you see then i guess youll like this one
1	I love Monte Carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this movie I thought everyone was very good I was not familiar with Richard Lewis I thought he made his character Julian Peters very personable funny and attractive Sean Young was very good as the befuddled rejected girl with a heart of gold George Hamilton was charming and the perfect Italian gigolo John Candy has a field day as the bon vivant James Belushi is hysterical as a total jerk Cybill Shepard gave a very sweet performance as a nice vulnerable ignored housewife Delightful ensemble cast Lots of talent clever script lots going on and beautiful locations Just a nice pick me up for a dreary day Especially in the winter when a trip to Europe is not anywhere on your horizon
0	I was really looking forward to this show given the quality of the actors and the fact that The Scott brothers were involved Unfortunately my hopes were dashed Yet again we are led to believe that the KGB are a group of inept morons who dont have a clue what they are doing At one point there is a laughable scene where 4 KGB agents couldnt handle one CIA agent I grow weary of these biased one sided and completely inaccurate portrayals of the Spy game that went on during the cold war I find it laughable that the US is incapable of making objective movies about their involvement in WW2 and beyond Just like the pathetic U571 where we are led to believe that the US obtained the Enigma machine again utterly falsebr br To its credit The Company is very well filmed and acted The locales are also exceptionally well realised Alfred Molina puts in a great performance as does Keaton The conflict between them is very well done I really wanted to like this show and no doubt I will end up watching the other 2 episodes but I really wish that US productions would stop trying to portray their Spies servicemen etc as supermen who are vastly intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet It gets old fast and seriously detracts from the plausibility of what could have been a 1010br br S
0	This movie was craptacular I was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the movies biggest antagonist was in fact myself I played it beautifully throughout promising myself I would walk away but only drinking another beer hoping it would automagically transform into something engrossing along the way Even in this state I couldnt help but notice that Cubas acting was as flimsy as tracing paper His obsessive dedication to his job was unconvincingly done as well as his one night binge after the failure of his own idiot standards Burt came on the screen as a General thats right a General who wears too much makeup I fell into a frighteningly fast binge to rival Cubas except mine was real and I stubbed my toe Recompense Recompense my stubbed toe
1	I was brought up on Doc Savageand was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now I found it thoroughly entertainingI have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactionsgranted they mostly think Im odd but there you are I dont know what it is about the Doc but he always gets the girls has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men This film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genreand was way before its timeit is not to be taken seriously move over Austin Powers Ron Ely is a GodIt is unfortunate that this film hasnt been released on DVD in the UK I dont think it should be remade and bastardised like I said its a classicit cannot be done without Ronlike the Italian job without Minis and Michael Caine I give it 1010
0	My wife and I watch a film every night with no distractions and mostly artsy films that require thought I have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom My wife has double the attention span that I do All that being said this film is just plain empty and BORING It went nowhere Never blossomed It started fairly strong with a promising plotthen she bakes cookiesgoes to Spainshe sulks she staresthe credits roll Uneven full of holes false starts dead ends We FFd through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space Artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried Zzzz Its like a beautifully shot chickflick thats pretending to be deep or artsy You never get to know nor understand Morvern at all About halfway through you just dont care anymore We just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop Dont waste your time on this Im shocked it scores so high
0	This movie is so so so horrible that it makes angels lose their wings Shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts like his work in ShaqFu for the NES and his plethora of unbearable rap albums and later the epic serving of horrible filmmaking that is Steelbr br Theres not a single good thing to be said about this movie I saw it a bunch of times when I was very young but I mustve been an idiot then because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart Its fun to mock I saw it on the Disney Channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that Although once the thrill of mocking it is done you still become overwhelmed by its terriblenessbr br If you see it on TV try this consider as your watching the film removing from it all the scenes in which Shaq uses his magical genie powers If you do that it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him Thats kinda funny and disturbingbr br A horrible example of film Do not unless looking to mock it see this movie
0	I wont add to the plot reviews its not very goodbr br Very improbable orphanage on Balabr br Cushing and Lee at their heightbr br Some nice scenerybr br Good for face spotting and I quote look at the mouth that is Cassie from Fools and Horsesbr br Otherwise a poor example of the British film industrybr br Fulton MacKay was far better in Fraggle Rock Keith Barron was better in anything else and Diana Dors did what she did bestbr br Redeeming feature It was free to watch on the Horror channel prior to its going over to subscription I wont be subscribing on this effort
0	Aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia I cant imagine anyone actually thinking this was a good movie
0	I stopped watching this POS as soon as the snakes started taking over the planebr br At first I thought maybe it should get a one for the comic relief But then I realized I could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more br br Whatever respect I might have had for Samuel Jackson has been irreversibly destroyed And Hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are When I was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun The only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay And no amount of Hollywood cartoon snakes can change thatbr br This movie isnt worth a trip to Blockbuster Be warned if you pay for it the only victim is your dumb assbr br If you want to be really scared I suggest the Descent If you want humor go to your local stand up comedy club Their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash
1	For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time No exceptions James Cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller Through films such as Aliens The Abyss and both Terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and sciencefiction goes He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows The story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for Cameron to make a truthful interesting and entertaining film about it The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films I get annoyed when the supporting characters arent given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly Rose Gloria Stuart tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is Roses and Jacks story alone no one else Emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home The music has become iconic and legendary It is composer James Horners finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience The song after so long has become annoying but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is Only one problem the usual James Cameron problem is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime My heart wont go on from this one
1	in 1976 i had just moved to the us from ceylon i was 23 and had been married for a little over three years and was beginning to come out as a lesbian i saw this movie on an old black and white TV with terrible reception alone and uninterrupted in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story i was living in a small house in tucson arizona and it was summertime like everyone else here i never forgot the feelings the images of this story called forth and its residue of fragile magic and i have treasured a hope that i would see it again someday ill keep checking in i also wish that someone would make a movie of shirley verels the other side of venus it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy
0	I wouldnt say this totally sucked but if it wasnt for Netflix I wouldnt even have this in my house Steve Martins eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat Hes just not funny Hes another in a LONG slew of SNL rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next SNL movie The birthing coach with the Elmer Fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original Amy Poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a 7 minute SNL skit which is about as funny as SNL lately The only thing going for this movie is that Tina Fey is easy on the eyes The ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldnt get pregnant The subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts but it seems to simple simmer along not really entertaining or creating laughs
1	Whether its a good movie or not films of this kind has to be made i think It remembers me of I love Huckabees a overwhelmingly puzzling movie with Isabelle Huppert being sodomized by a young American in a mud pond in a merry sadisticmasochist way I hope the director will go on stepping across the border as though i felt the choices Vincenzo Natali made were not always subtle some of the scenes were unhappily kind of tarteàlacrème like a childish slapstick speaking about script and cinematography The color of Cube was black Nothing is white more cheerful surprisingly than the former films of Natali
1	Bruce Almighty one of Carreys best pictures since well a long time It contains one of the funniest scenes I have seen for a long time too Morgan Freeman plays God well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny It contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes The best scene in it is where Jim is messing up the anchor mans voicebr br My rating 810
0	when discussing a movie titled snakes on a plane we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plotbr br what we have here are very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes snakes are scary because they appear to be slimy they crawl they slither these snakes do nothing of the sort they glide along like they would in a video game they are cartoon snakes i would go as far to say that even someone that had a major phobia against real snakes would not find these ones scarybr br why on earth then would you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures why not rely on suspense the whole less is more ethic or better still why not just make them look good in the first place and then maybe still use them sparinglybr br take one look at john carpenters the thing here we have real slime and gore of eerie proportions 20 years go by and we get this pile of stinking sfx crap snakes on a plane when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee special effects are going backwardsbr br sure you could say but the movie is a joke get it sure im with that idea but do it well in addition to the above this movie has crap dialogue and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any waybr br i could handle every other actor being part of this movie except for jackson what was he doing there the man who starred in pulp fiction 10 years ago is this career progression are you offering people value for money no id like to know what Tarantino thought when he was half way through this stinker of a moviebr br the current generation seem to have very low expectations and Hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want on leaving the cinema i saw a number of advertisements for some truly horrendous looking future releases including DOA dead or alive another cgi animal film called flushed away and another crap looking comedy named click in addition to that i saw some awful trailers including one for another crap British horrorcomedy ive truly not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long timebr br expect to see this movie for sale in the DVD bargain section for £1 in 6 months time and if youre expecting to see a black comedy with tonnes of great looking snakes and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l jacksons lips forget it
1	The fact that this film was put out on DVD still formattedto TV and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film puristsand rightly so This deserves a lot better treatmentbr br The story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft the rules of the day and winds up with a little girl instead not the conventional way and the problems that ensue afterward The old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy which he obviously thought was the casebr br The old man Bianlian Wang Xu Zhuis kind of funnylooking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin The little girl Doggie Zhou Renying is a cutie The rest of the story is how the two manage after that I usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final 15 minutesbr br Overall its involving story complete with drama suspense humor and sadness Just dont expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the DVD Until it comes out on widescreen rent it
0	Id give this a negative rating if I could I went into this movie not expecting much but I had an open mind The whole thing is stupid The snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson Oh how original if I were a 12 year old boy I might laugh at that I have no idea how this movie became so popular Seriouslythe worst thing Ive ever seen I wasnt entertained it wasnt funnyI wasnt even bored I wasnt anything It wasnt even so bad it was good its just bad Ridiculous actually Please do not waste your money on this movie Dont even rent this movie No clue how its getting such a high rating
0	When I first saw this film it was not an impressive one Now that I have seen it again with some friends on DVD they had not viewed it on the silver screen my opinion remains the same The subject matter is puerile and the performances are weak
0	Noting the cast I recently watched this movie on TCM hoping for an underappreciated gem as I regard many films from the 30s This is no gem not even semiprecious The anachronistic clothing and 1930s Rolls Royce limo hit you immediately The casting is strange also But mostly there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices This film has lots of good ingredients and a basic plot that holds promise but the components arent mixed according to the right recipe It simply doesnt come together like it should And thats a shame WIth a few rather obvious but minor alterations this might have been a very good moviebr br The film is about an American showgirl Jean Harlow seeking a rich British husband preferably from the nobility She meets Franchot Tone and his buddy who are on a lark in a Rolls Royce owned by his buddys employer Harlow mistakenly assumes Tone is the Lord who owns the Rolls and she sets her sights on him This early part of the film is a light comedy of no real distinction br br However Tone unwittingly uncovers the fact that his employer is actually a German 5th columnist on the eve of WWI and that is when the movie changes tone altogether and begins to fall apart Tone and Harlow are married but just as the honeymoon begins he is gunned down by a Mata Haritype Benita Hume and Harlow flees the scene with a bystander accusing her of Tones murder In fact Tone recovers from the woundsbr br Harlow flees to France where she falls in love again this time with a wealthy French cad Cary Grant Tone now in the army and Harlow are unexpectedly brought back together in Grants hospital room where he is in rehab from a plane crash In the following scene Tone accuses Harlow of abandoning him because she is essentially a golddigger Harlow never explains about the witness accusing her of murder and her panic That is one of those unreal movieplotdevice breakdowns in the storybr br Then Tone is also brought back into contact with the woman Hume who shot him She is on hand to watch her paramour Grant test the new plane that Tone has delivered to him from England Incredibly both Hume and Tone dimly recognize each other but simply cant place where from Okay so Tone was shot and almost died perhaps his memory is a little out of whack But how many men did Hume shoot that she would forget one of her marks She does not seem to be faking the memory lapsebr br This is inexplicable and unnecessary Hume should have absolutely recognized him but played it coy when she realized that Tone wasnt able to place her That would have been a much better treatment of that issuebr br The finale also is very unsatisfying The movie as made has Tone and Harlow conspiring to preserve the good reputation of the cad Grant leading to his fraudulent burial as a hero Then Harlow and Tone just walk away It is noble to preserve the French publics perception of their national war hero but very unsatisfying as a love storybr br What the film begs for is this Harlow explains that she fled in a panic in the face of accusations of murder Tone forgives her and quietly rekindles his love for her he then carries a torch for her even while helping her to rig the crash site to preserve Grants reputation Meanwhile Harlow finally recognizes Grant for the cad he is Then having seen Tone for the brave and noble man he is Harlow rekindles feelings for him too At films end the two of them become reconciled even as they work together to rig the appearance of Grants death After Grants heros burial we see them embrace and kiss at the fadeout That would have made a nice little movie For Cary Grant fans it would have been even better had Tone played the French cad who is killed and Grant the longsuffering first husband reunited with Harlowbr br It is incomprehensible that Franchot Tone is cast as the Irishman living in England while Cary Grant is cast as the Frenchman This movie would have been much better had they reversed roles That also would have been more conducive to the film that should have been
0	OK first of all Steve Irwin rest in peace You were loved by many fans Nowthis movie wasnt a movie at all It was The Crocodile Hunter TV program with bad acting bad scripts and bad directing in between Steve capturing or teaching us about animals He was entertaining as an animal seekerspecialist Millions will miss him But the whole movie idea was a big mistake The plot was so broken it was almost nonexistent Casting was horrible The acting wasnt even worth elementary schoollevel actors The direction must be faulted as well If you cant get a halfway decent performance out of your actors no matter how bad the script is you must not be that good in the first place I could have written a better script I wish I had never been to see this movie Of course I watched it for 3 150 for me 150 for my son while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action My son who is not so discriminating liked the movie alright but he still has never asked to see it again If you want fond memories of Steve Irwin buy his series on DVD Avoid this movie like the plague If I were Steve I know I wouldnt want to be remembered for this movie Respect him avoid this movie
0	This movie is not based on the bible It completely leaves Christ out of the movie They do not show the rapture or the second coming of Christ Let alone talk about it It does not quote from scriptures The end times are called the great tribulation The movie does not even show bad times The seven bowls seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a 15 second news cast of the sea changing its structure The antiChrist was killed 3 12 years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended The only part they got correct was there was two prophets The did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures The worst part of it was I really wanted it to be a good movie I wanted to take unsaved people to it I feel that the movie is evil It is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does I just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind booksbr br The second problem with the movie is it was just bad Bad acting bad special effects bad plot and poor character development I have seen better episodes of Miami vice
0	The idea is nice Bringing so many stars in one movie is great But too many stories too short and lacking really any sense No connection between the scenes There were some 34 brilliant stories but these were out of 18 The frame reminded me of All the invisible children a movie which I liked a lot Compared to it however Paris Je TAime lacks the intriguing short story which develops starts and has its end And it lacks the topic connecting all those children I do not find Paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short sketches togetherPerhaps for people who know Paris it is interesting Otherwise I wouldnt recommend it
1	The storyline of The Thief of Bagdad is complex owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together The screenplay by Lajo Biros and the dialogue by Miles Malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all pointsThe young King Ahmad of Bagdad is angry at his vizier Jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas He discovers while in disguise that people blame him for Jaffars deeds and hate him He is imprisoned by Jaffar where he meets Abu the young thief The two escape and take a boat to the city of Basra There the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the Princess of the city passing by Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden He tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss Then he is captured When Jaffar comes to win the Princess of Basra for himself Ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns Abu into a dog Jaffar then asks for the Princesss hand and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the Sultan of Basra The blind Ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace accompanied by Abu as his dog The Prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her So Jaffar sends his servant Halima for Ahmad and the dog in hopes the prince can rouse her He does awaken her She boards a ship to find a doctor to cure Ahmad but she is captured by Jaffar who then throws the dog overboard She then allows Jaffar to take her in his arms on his promise to restore Ahmads sight and turn Abu back into a thief The princess sees a vision of Ahmad he is in a boat Jaffar sends a storm to beset him and Abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island Abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle Abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel then corks him in again For freeing him he gets three wishes His first is for sausages In the meanwhile the Princess pleads with her father to refuse Jaffar but Jaffar shows the Sultan a new mechanical toy one of whose six arms stabs him to death Abu makes a second wish to find Ahmad The cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the AllSeeing eye Abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye battling a giant spider then scaling the goddesss statue Abu gazes into the eye and sees Ahmad in a canyon He has the genie take him to Ahmad Ahmad uses the eye to see the princess She smells a flower and forgets everything at once Abu wishes they were in Bagdad but the genie laughs and leaves Jaffar tells the Princess that she is in love with him omitting mention of Ahmad Ahmad tries to fight his way to the Princess but Jaffar smashes the eye Abu finds himself in the Land of Legend where the old men who rule want to make him their king He steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead to hurry to save Ahmad and the princess The thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner using his bow from the flying carpet to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution Jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse but another shot from the bow finishes him Ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his Princess but when he tries to make Abu his vizier the young thief refuses saying that what he wants is adventure not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be This fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer Alexander Korda The production was designed by Vincent Korda who was also art director while Georges Perinal did the colorful cinematography The directors credited are Ludwig Berger and Michael Powell with Tim Whelan Alexander Korda William Cameron Menzies and Zoltan Korda participating The extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of John Armstrong Oliver Messel and Marcel Vertes The production apart from its gorgeous and expensivelooking visual splendors I claim is dominated by two other elements the choral music of Miklos Rozsa and the performance by Conrad Veidt as the evil Jaffar Rex Ingram plays the genie with a curious accent plus his usual intelligence and power June Duprez is lovely and effective as the Princess Mary Morris is a sad and beautiful Halima and Miles Malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious Sultan As Ahmad John Justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some he is memorably good in his winning role This film has a spaciousness about it that is found I assert in other Korda works also Its imaginative content stands in contrast to verystrong realistic sets costumes and setdesign elements This is one of the most memorable idealevel fantasies of all time worthy to be enjoyed over and over
1	Somewhat funny and wellpaced action thriller that has Jamie Foxx as a hapless fasttalking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding US Treasury Agent David Morse to be released on the streets of New York to find a picky computer thiefhacker Doug Hutchinson who stole fortytwo million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot deadbr br Bait marks the sophomore feature for Antoine Fuqua The Replacement Killers and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesnt top his first movie What the two films have in common is the action sequences which are flatout excellentbr br Foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning but throughout the film I began to catch on Hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as John Malkovich and patient as the late Laurence Olivier was in Marathon Man Morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost

1	I love this movie It is one of those movies that you can watch time and time again and still find engaging Congratulations I believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves It is so eerie you feel like you are watching a real life band I would like to see more movies like this I am glad that they did not choose famous Hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked And even if Billy Connolly is quite well known he really got stuck into the role and I could not imagine anybody else playing it Congratulations again I really believe this movie deserves the Peter Sellers Comedy Award for Bill Nighy And when you get to the final scene well what can I say

1	enjoyed the movie and efficient Confucian crime drama the old order survives the threat posed by a brash young greedy man no doubt representing modern society I thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big D was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long I loved the scene and for once in a Chinese movie the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest On thing that always amuses me about HK films is that the main influence the British seem to have had is to introduce yes sir and sorry into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone they are still there
1	An excellent example of the spectacular Busby Berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930s Audiences mustve been very surprised to see James Cagney in this type of vehicle Quite a contrast from his Public Enemy 2 years earlier Cagney does add spark interest to a rather routine tired out formulated storyline plot But the highlight of the movie is the 3 elaborate production numbers back to back First with the conservative Honeymoon Hotel numberthen followed by the very spectacularly eye dazzling By A Waterfall sequencefollowed by the closing Shanghai Lil sequence Cagney only participates in the last number hoofing it up on top of a bar counter with Ruby Keeler The Shanghai Lil number with Cagney is excellent but a bit of a comedown anti climactic after the more exciting incredibly mind boggling By A Waterfall choreographyIf I was the director I wouldve inserted the Shanghai Lil number in the middle close with By A Waterfallwhich blows the other 2 numbers out of the water so to speak in my view the best of the 3 numbers The 3 production numbers are the frosting on the cake James Cagneys performance is added decoration to the cake An outstanding musical achievementa 4 star movie the ultimate musicalwell worth watchingyou wont be disappointed

1	Dominion Tank Police is without a shell of a doubt one of the most amazing shows ever produced but not just in the field of animation While the first part Acts 1 and 2 mostly consists of action and fun the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part The subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant You must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second Part Acts3 and 4 I do have some complaints though In the first part the Tank Bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all One might also question the plausibility of Bonaparte jumping on the wing of Helicopter Gunship even though it was cool Buaku rules
1	Even this early in his career Capra was quite accomplished with his camerawork and his timing This is a thin story and quite predictable at times but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately The first part looks like a Cinderella story though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that the rich prince will lose his fortunebr br Nonetheless because of his good cast and fast pace its easy to get caught up in the clichés Then the movie does become more original as the married couple have to find a way to make a living The ending is very predictable but satisfying I also want to compliment the titlewriting very witty and fun
0	This film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California She thought it was wonderful because it was so real Just the way people in the Ohio Valley are Im from the area and I experienced the film as Just the way people in California think we are Ive lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there We laughed a lot we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age the young people went out together at night The older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families The area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere elsebr br Aside from the if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed condescension the story lacked any elements of charm mystery or even a sense of dreadbr br Marthas character was the worst drawn Its doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church but if she had she probably would have made friends there Ive read reviews that seem to assume Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was younger prettier and thinner but if this is the case it isnt shown All we actually see is Martha learning to dislike Rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender We see Martha feeling left out during smoking sessions left out of the loop when social plans are made used but not appreciated and finally disrespected and hurtbr br Just one more thing Are we supposed to suspect Kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks Please This takes stigma against mental illness to a new level

0	Iedereen Beroemd has everything we can expect from a straight to videomovie Its the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star The only thing he needs is to get her on stage surrounded by cameras and reporters A simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail The problem with the movie is not the basic plot but how it is made Everything is supposed to be funny but it isnt It is trivial and clumsy the characters are shallow and the endsequence is totally without climax or emotion The last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing but only at how pathetic the whole setup is

0	My wife and I just finished this movie and I came onto to IMDb to commiserate with the reviewers that found this movie less than satisfactory However of the 10 pages of reviews only a handful are negative I feel that this movie is a great concept gone horribly awry and I want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie into the futurebr br I admit Im more inspired to write reviews when I dont like a movie than as to when I do so my handful of reviews are all negative Still that doesnt mean Im biased towards not enjoying a movie but I often find more eloquent reviews of movies I do enjoybr br Paris je taime is the most pretentious movie Ive seen in years By using an intelligent concept and attaching some big talent to a couple of the WAY to many short stories the movie ends up the worst of all worlds It is art for arts sake but something that a 2 year old could dream up and accomplish Giving the director free reign of 5 minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment Directors cant write writers cant direct Id like to throw in also that Clint Eastwood is overrated but that is because hes an actor turn director which rarely works eitherbr br What ends up on the screen is a garbled mess of short stories that dont make any sense are not completed in 5 minutes and in total spoil Paris to me Why call it Paris je taime when a more apropos title is cluster fck There are only a couple stories that are watchable most notably the piece by Alfonso Cuarón but everything else will fall into obscurity The Coen brothers short is passable but can you name a movie of theirs that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar Its as if all the directors decided on doing whatever it is they want to do and chose Paris as the place to do it As we all love Paris present company included we are blinded by the fact that this movie SUCKS In fact I think they put the directors names on each of the shorts because directors saw how poor of a film this is and decided to make sure they were blamed only for their 5 minutes Seriously SERIOUSLYbr br People Natalie Portman is NOT a good actress She is is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be yours And Maggie Gyllenhaal why Are you people acting or just regurgitating performances from other movies Im looking at you Natalie Portman Garden State Closer Elijah Wood Sin City and Catalina Sandino Moreno Maria Full of Gracebr br One final comment on the acting I give double kudos to Nick Nolte for acting and looking more humane than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again Find his short on youtube as his 5 minutes are quite enjoyablebr br Writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have gotten it right Im thinking of Ernst Hemingway Raymond Carver F Scott Fitzgerald and John Cheever just to name a few It is much harder than writing a full novel and only the truly talented can accomplish this The same can be said about short films It appears that only one director will live on in the annals of historybr br If you uphold Paris as a gem to be discovered and reflected through your own lenses with your own story then dont expect to enjoy this movie at all The directors either didnt care or were lazy In either scenario by the time you are reading this it means you rented it Praise be that you didnt pay 10 dollars a head in theaters for it
1	I havent always been a fan but the show grew on me It wasnt until after season 5 that I started to see the richness of the show They finally brought Daniel Jacksons search for his wife to an end and finally most of the Goould System Lords were killed by rival Lords SG1 or othersbr br Towards Season 5 Stargate SG1 was beginning to become stale With the new writers and the close attention by Produer Peter Deleuise the show became more and more solidbr br The characters had become stale as well Colonel Jack ONeill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage After his son Charlie was killed in a shooting accident with ONeills weapon he had decided to end his own life by going to Abydos in order to face off with the Goould RA The character offers little growth for any actor and actor Richard Dean Anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself only allowing his close friends inbr br Amanda Tapping joined the cast as Captain Samantha Carter She was a feminist on the edge ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job Though this character had little area to grow Tapping has done a great job of concentrating on Carters strengths She has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things Carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently br br Christopher Judge joined the cast playing the alien Tealc Tealc was an alien called the Jaffa Infant Goould snake like creatures would embed themselves into the Jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form The Jaffa would die Tealc was the First Prime of Apophis army Knowing that Apophis was not a god like Goould pretend he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy Finally having had enough he and Jack ONeill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people After arriving on Earth he realized that Earth was the planet he was looking for who would help him fight the Goould Christopher Judge has done quite a bit with a limited character Tealc is a wise warrior much of which he learned was from his teacher Master Bratac The show would not be complete without Master Bratac played by Tony Amandola He is also a rock In the end he became adviser to most of SG1 especially Daniel Jackson br br Don S Davil was there from the beginning playing Major General George Hammand Davis has done an incredible job with Hammond making him sympathetic and normal He does his job has a wife sons and daughters and grandchildren You can really say he is the anchor of the base Simply I would die for that man If not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world He will go himself He doesnt leave anyone behindbr br I saved Dr Daniel Jackson for last because this character I believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on In choosing Shanks I dont think the producer realized how strong Shanks would be and now when people talk about Jackson they dont talk about Spader they talk about Shanks In the early years the Jackson character came off as a whiner Thats why I probably wasnt a fan As the seasons pasted the character became stronger This gave him confidence In the end as of season 10 the Jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero He still monitors the groups ethics He still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward Acheaology History Culture and Exploration are part of his very being He is determined Though a man of peace he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement br br Other characters include most recently Vala Mal DoranClaudia Black and Colonel Cameron MitchellBen Browder new lead of SG1 Both actors come from a series called Farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess I see little difference between Mitchell and Crichton Farscape character Blacks character is simply off the wall Definitely different from her soldier like character Arin Soon
1	This is a very funny Ealing comedy about a community in central London who through an unusual set of circumstances discover they are not English but are an annex of the French province of Burgundybr br The film features comic actor Stanley Holloway best known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY as well as a host of other classic comic actors of the periodbr br The story was apparently based on a news item at the time when the Canadian Government officially gave a hotel room to a visiting European member of royalty The idea actually reminded me of the reallife case of the Hutt River Province in Western Australia where a landowner seceded from the Australian Government due to a wool quota dispute It was never acknowledged by the Western Australian or Australian Governmentsbr br This is a great script that plays with a lot of political and economic issues rather like the TV show Yes Minister as well as being a great little eccentric character piece as well
0	An ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable characters twist and turn their way through a flimsy plot that might be interesting if only you could bring yourself to care This twisting and turning I speak of refers not to the story which contains all the suspense of a recipe for tuna casserole but to the directors inability to keep the characters faces even remotely centered in the frame On the other hand Angie Harmon has very nice nostrils and left earbr br The only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced to do it When you consider this movie was never released in theaters despite having an allstar cast you might be inclined to think something stinksbr br And indeed it does

1	I spotted in the guide to films list for the Santa Barbara Film Festival where I went when I was in Hollywood that this film was in screening Basically there is an election for the new chairman of the Hong Kong Triads Wo Sing Society coming up so you can imagine how much violence that is going to occur during this The struggle is between candidates Lam Lok Simon Yam and Big D Tony Leung Ka Fai for control of the oldest and most powerful Triad parts of the society Also starring Louis Koo as Jimmy Lee Nick Cheung as Jet Cheung Siu Fai as Mr So Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun There are some good realistic corruption themes and moments just about enough action apart from maybe when the cops get involved but a sequel followed so its a pretty worthwhile crime drama thriller Very good
1	This is surprisingly above average slasher thats enjoyable and well made with some decent gore All the characters are decent and the story is quite fun plus Molly Ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well I bought this at a pawn shop for a 1 and it was surprisingly worth it and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget plus I loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy The finale was really cool as I loved how they defeated the killer and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well plus all the characters except for Ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable Its decently made and written and I thought it was quite creative and original at times as well plus some of the death scenes were very impressive This killer didnt mess around and I loved it and Slasher fanslike myself should really enjoy this film plus The opening was really wicked too with them filming the movie This is a surprisingly above average slasher thats enjoyableand well made with some decent gore and I say its well worth the watch The Direction is good Kimble Rendall does a good job here with solid camera work using a creepy setting good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace The acting is solid Molly Ringwald plays the bitch extremely welland I had troubles feeling sorry for her after all she was supposed to be the heroine she turned out better towards the end but not by much Im surprised she decided to do this film nonetheless she did an excellent job Frank Roberts is fantastic as the killer he is menacing creepy and had one hell of a mask and this guy didnt mess around he was fantastic Kylie Minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role Jessica Napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine Rest of the cast are fine Overall well worth the watch out of 5

1	I avoided watching this film for the longest time Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an overhyped overblown overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz and I wanted nothing to do with it I never watched it in the theatre I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards even though I had never seen it Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest One of the girls spoke about this movie It was so great she said You really felt like you were on the ship Nonsense I thought I shared my feelings with my fellow judges One looked at me and said you might be right but if she liked the movie that much maybe shell want to learn more about the real Titanic The movie must have done something right to get her so interested Well maybe thought I Then it finally appeared on Pay TV OK I thought Ill give it a look see I didnt want to like it and I didnt I loved it What a great moviebr br Where to start First the directing My high school public speaking contestant was right James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads then the rising sense of panic You dont just watch it you really do feel it Then the performances The lead performances from Kate Winslet as Rose and Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack are excellent Winslets being the superior I thought but both were good They had their rich girlpoor boy characters down to a perfect t I thought In my opinion though stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Roses mother She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack Then the details Im no expert on the sinking of the Titanic but I have a reasonable general knowledge and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance Very impressive indeed Then the song Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dions performance of My Heart Goes Onbr br Problems Well the romance was perhaps too contrived in the sense that I just dont accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class I know he was invited the first time but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until hes been there for a while The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed I thought when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats br br A minor quibble though This is truly an excellent movie My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre where I think it would have been so much more impressivebr br 910

0	Proof that not everything Tarantino touches turns to gold This is most definitely plastic all the way Its easy to see that without Quentins involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for years thats assuming it would have ever got produced in the first place It is about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes Angela Jones is unconvincing in this role William Baldwin is better as the Serial Killer who keeps Jones in employment All in all pretty poor
0	The Golden Era of Disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the 90s This show Quack Pack shouldnt even be considered a DuckTales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with DuckTales Its about a teenaged Huey Dewey and Louie as they make trouble for their uncle Donald and talk in hiphop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in DuckTales I prefer the little adventurous nephews from DuckTales There are humans in Duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in Duckburg Theres no references of Scrooge McDuck The stories are repetitive the plot is boring but the animation is good If you want lots of slapstick humor I recommend this to you If you want a better Disney show watch Darkwing Duck or DuckTales
1	This is a long lost horror gem starring Sydney Lassick Carrie and others and Barbara Bach It is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but its worth it This film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time It seems that 3 young newswomen Karen Vicky and Jennifer travel to the small city of Solvang California to cover a festival when a mixup occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of Earnest Keller Lassick and his strange wife Virginia Vickie stays behind feeling ill as the other 2 are off to film their story She is soon murdered at the house in a VERY cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system she is decapitated by the closing cover of the vent as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement Soon Karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face rammed through the vent cover Jennifer is fighting with her exlover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home her hosts whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son devise a plot to try to murder her as well Virgina does not totally agree with Earnests plan to murder Jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets Junior Here the film turns almost comic as Junior portrayed hysterically by Stephen Furst is a deformed mentally deficient manchild whose actions and motions will cause a few chuckles even though its supposed to be scary This is where the pace of the film picks up and the ending is well done The actorsactresses do a terrific job with the material especially Lassick Furst and Bach and although its not the most horrifying film ever made it is highly entertaining
0	All internet buzz aside this movie was god awful I expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything Instead the film makers tried to make a serious thrillerhorror movie and they completely missed There were only a few good parts and a couple good lines by Samuel Jackson Other than that it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes All of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie Now that the movie has actually come out hopefully this joke will die Dont waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash If youre looking for something thats funny and entertaining then just go to Snakes on a Blog

1	Bruce Almighty looks and sounds incredibly stupid especially from the trailers Nevertheless I found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more Bruce Jim Carrey is angry at God and is given divine powers by him to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized here as God and though it isnt his usual type of film or one of his best roles he does excellent with what he is given to work with Although crude at times the film does have quite a few laughs from Bruce parting his soup in half like the Red Sea and the customers reactions to him as well as Freemans seemingly laidback and wisecracking image of God It is overly exaggerated at times and there is some crude humor but overall it manages to be somewhat funny There is a decent supporting cast such as Jennifer Aniston Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carrell which always helps The end of the film proves to be very romantic and tearjerking and the message is clear that we should do what God has called us to do and be the miracle The film is far from perfect but still enjoyable and far better than I and many people probably would have expected especially if we see the deeper message of the filmbr br out of
0	This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen quite a few movies It is passed off as an art film but it is really a piece of trash Its one redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dancing but that cannot make up for Sally Potters disgustingly obvious tribute to herself The plot of this movie is nonexistent and I guarantee you will start laughing by the end Especially where she starts singing Its absolutely unreal
0	We open with Colonel Luc Deveraux Van Damme the original Universal Soldier and his buxom Asian friend being chased down a river by what appear to be Universal Soldiers They almost kill the two then oh wait it was just a field test Deveraux we come to find is now part of a government funded company that designs the new level of Universal Soldiers Why he would want to be involved in this if you know anything about the original is never explained and well beyond mebr br Its after this flimsy set piece that the real story gets going The United States government has cut the Universal Soldiers project budget and in the process angered SETH the large artificial mainframe computer that controls the Universal Soldiers Naturally he wont be shut down without a fight So that means Van Damme has to go around and take all the new breed of Universal Soldiers out Which sounds like a fun idea for an action movie and a take on a sequel but that doesnt stop it from becoming stupid as hell br br For instance one of the new Universal Soldiers is played by Bill Goldberg Seems you cant go wrong casting a wrestler in an action movie Hes big hes tough right Wrong Van Damme doesnt seem to have a problem wiping the floor with him once twice three times The point here lost on me Then theres the breaking of glass A rudimentary part of any action movie but someone involved must have a glass fetish You have to see the fight scenes in particular Lets not talk about how nobody cuts themselves or at the very least slips Then to put the cherry on top of this train wreck they have SETH the computer secure a human body for himself and how appropriate it is when they make the villain black Michael Jai White Nothing works better than a white good guy fighting a black bad guy it would seem Potentially offensive and just downright lame Hes no replacement for Dolph eitherbr br Universal Soldier 2 is a lousy sequel Its loud its dumb and it doesnt care The original wasnt anything poetic but it made a simple sort of sense with a science fiction element and it entertained on a basic level The sequel doesnt They do however keep the running time under ninety minutes and somehow found a way to squeeze in a strip club sequence So give credit where credit is due
0	OMG The only reason Im giving this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because Tom Hanks is funny as an Elvisinthebox Apart from that how did this halfway decent cast sign on to do such a lame movie Maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time There are no laughs to mention the stereotypes are pathetic the cast is wasted the direction is amateurish Now that I think about it most of the blame probably lies with the director Joel Zwick He brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved Dont waste your time like I did but then I enjoy a good train wreck Geez now the system is telling me I need more lines here ya go This movie should be called Return to Sender Okay now THAT was funnier than anything in the movie

0	One of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious yuppies is satisfying it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be mocked One of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they the yuppies are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art While the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning I find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner If these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home I would bet that American Psycho would be one of those movies

1	Incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over NYC on that fateful morning of September 11th Intense personal and completely riveting 911 is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident which kind of gives it an even greater appeal Up until that morning filmmakers Gideon and Jules Naudet had been following around a New York firefighter team concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman Out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup Jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center and from there a simple documentary was no morebr br Viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero as the amazing group of firefighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster Without hesitation Naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while its entire support crumbles around them The raw fear of an unknown impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside Nearly as memorable is older brother Gideons candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed By the time we get to see the second tower collapse as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly upclose footage capturedbr br Obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage even if it cost them their own safetybr br After viewing 911 and seeing that it came out in 2002 I feel much more resentment towards Oliver Stones recent rendition the big budgeted World Trade Center Many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble and although I enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental Hollywood focus it brought 911 all but renders his film completely obsolete Not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again

1	Superslick entertainment with a stellar cast an outstanding script and a firm grip on the approaching 1950s At the time RKO was turning out classic noirs by the dozens But whatever the value of those shadowy downers they reflected a wartime mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the Eisenhower era Few films of the late40s are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedybr br Jim Blandings Cary Grant works as an adman on Madison Ave where in his little daughters words he sells things to people that they dont need at prices they cant afford Hes making good money but like thousands of others hes tired of living in a cramped urban cave So with wife Myrnah Loy they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the Connecticutt countryside Needless to say in the arms of nature they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashionbr br Theres hardly a lifeless line in the entire script I dont know if writers Panama and Frank got an Oscar but they should have Of course the humor revolves around all the problems that popup when city people build a big house on rural land The annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving Grant a hard time Of course no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than Grant so its just one wellplaced laugh after another particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own Yet oddly the film appears to have no comedic highpoint Instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they dont peak at any particular point Thats a real movie triumph for any erabr br Reaching back 60 years later we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind With their livein maid the Blandings may not be a typical American family but that postwar migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical And what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than Blandings as an adman tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more ham More than anything however theres the movies sunny optimism Oh sure the feeling falters at times yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the Blandings just stick to their dream carries them through Indeed life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge so I expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day Its that easily overlooked subtext along with the sheer entertainment value that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the postwar periodbr br So if you havent seen it catch it next time around

0	In its depiction of a miserable Milanese underclass this film was probably quite revealing in its day However I get the feeling that neorealism was never really director De Sicas bag since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country After spending most of his childhood in an orphanage Toto ends up living in a shantytown in Milan He organises the inhabitants into community action and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables That nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me as these people have far more important things to think about like where the next Pot Noodle is going to come from Anyway De Sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are Its all down to capitalism of course and in order to illustrate this he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land Brilliant To his credit though by this time he has given up on making a serious film and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures all fur coats and cigars They want that land but our mathematical hero will not support such nonsense By a bizarre stroke of luck his old deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove He uses it to shower gifts on his mates who prove just as greedy as the cigar men I reckon this film was a missed opportunity To address the theme of poverty as not many filmmakers had done until then and then get caught up in a fairy tale to me seems a bit daft How come great directors get away with childlike plot turns like the ones we see here Hans Christian Anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the Milan Duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks De Sica however is proclaimed as a genius for this Surely the fact that these people are so poor that their faith is unswerving and that miracles never happen to them is enough for any storyteller to work onbr br

1	The scintillating Elizabeth Taylor stars in this lesserknown classic as a young girl from London who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from British Ceylon current day Sri Lanka Upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd William Dieterle who also directed The Life Of Emile Zola and Portrait Of Jennie does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark and almost eerie undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful Ive seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery
1	me and my sister use to rent this every time we got movies and our parents would get so mad at so but they let us anyways and I love itI cant find anyone that lives near me that knows what I am talking aboutIm glad to see that Im not the only one that loved this movieI wish i could find this on DVD somewhere I would love to watch this now just bc I loved it so much as a little kidand Im 15 now I remember so much about itthats where I got the little bunny fufu song from and all my friends know the song but not the movie I think the little girl got there by sliding down the slide on her little playground thing
1	This is a great entertaining action film in my opinion with cool characters lots of action and an amazing performance from Dolph Lundgren however Alex Karzis is awful as the villain The story is very good and i found the kids to be likable for the most part plus Dolph Lundgren is simply amazing in this The action scenes are excellent and its almost like Die Hard except its set in a school plus Kata Dobó is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick The finale is very exciting and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well however i just wished it had another villain because Alex Karzis just didnt cut it as the villain way too OTT and laughable for my tastes This should be higher then 41 in my opinion as i thought it was a great action film and while the kids were very stupid at times they got quite resourceful as the movie went along plus the shootouts were pretty cool as well The ending is very amusingand Corey Seviers character was my favorite student plus Dolph has still got it This is a great entertaining action film in my opinion with cool characters lots of action and an amazing performance from Lundgren but Alex Karzis is awful as the villain still i highly recommend this one The Direction is very good Sidney J Furie does a very good job here with great camera work good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace There is a bit of blood and violence We get lots of extremely bloody gunshot woundsknife in the side of the head bloody arrow hits an impaling and other minor stuff The Acting is fantastic Dolph Lundgren is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable kicks that ass as usual had great chemistry with the kids had an awesome character is very charismatic and he may not have shown a great emotional rage he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch he is one of my favorite actors Lundgren Rules Alex Karzis is god awful as the villain he is laughably OTT was boring and not menacing at all he also annoyed the crap out of me Kata Dobó is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do she was the real villain in my opinion Corey Sevier is funny as Mick he was my favorite student and i really started to warm up to him in the 2nd half i liked him a lot he had good chemistry with Dolph too Dov TiefenbachWillyChris CollinsHogieMpho KoahoJay TeeDanielle HamptonAliciaNicole DickerCharlee all do great as the students Jennifer Baxter is very cute and is good as The fiancée rest of the cast do fine Overall i highly recommend this one 12 out of 5
1	I enjoyed every moment of this movie even though I knew they could never really be together With the life expectancy of a Bomber pilot being only six weeks It made me feel for all of those women and men back in the 1940s who must have lived this story
1	Plenty has been written about Mamets The House of Games most of it good I decided to revisit the flick to see how it held up after 17 years and was surprised at how much I enjoyed viewing it again The films success and durability probably has much to do with two principal ingredients which are always fun on film a good story and a good scam Mamet manages to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while scamming us the audience and the mark simultaneously Then he explains the art of conning only to do it again etc all the while building the story The House of Games now a freebie on cable is worth a look for first timers and an okay rerun for Mamet fans B
0	I was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was Was the viewer supposed to learn something or reflect on anything here What was up with the pumpkins Was I supposed to be impressed with the motel shots Does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel Why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery The best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finishedbr br I am truly amazed I believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community
1	than this What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams would have worked together on one movie This movie starts with a touch of Brazil when at a certain point the story moves straight into the twilight zone bringing up nothing new but just nothing and nothing is great fun When Dave and Andrew starts to explore their new environment the movie gets really enjoyable bouncing heads well yes br br anyway this movie was imho the biggest surprise at this years FantasyFilmFestbr br Just like in Cube and Cypher Natali gave this one a minimalistic weird but very special design which makes it hard to locate the place of the story or its time timeless somehow
0	This is a typical perfect crime thriller A perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer ignoring all the clues immediately knows who guilty is The audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught The result is like every single episode of Columbo or murder she wrote The director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of Matlock This story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book Skip this one you are not missing anything
1	Ive had a lot of experience with women in Russia and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like unfortunately They are very cunning ruthless and greedy as well as highly unfair From the robotic sex the hustling for gifts to the lies and betrayal Ive experienced it all in Russiabr br I know what Im talking about And here are my qualifications Here are the photojournals of my three trips to Russia in search of a bride It includes thousands of pics of many hot Russian girls I met black comedy scams I was privy to and the story of my mugging and appearance on Russian national TVbr br httpwwwhappierabroadcomPhotojournalshtmbr br Its like Reality TV You will love it I spent a ton of time putting it together So check it out The Russian woman that Nicole Kidman plays is a lot like the Julia and Katya in my photojournalsbr br My 3 bride seeking trips in Russia happen to be very exciting and would sell so why dont they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in Russia However there is one factual impossibility in this film and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a catalog and having her arrive at an airport It doesnt work that way at all so I dont understand why the media likes to perpetuate this There isnt a single Russian bride introduction website that works this way and I challenge anyone to find one that does The fact is you can only order the Russian ladys CONTACT INFO email address phone number etc from the website From there you correspond and then visit her and if you want to bring her to your country you start the immigration process at your INS office and wait months after that Thats how it works in real life You cant just order her to arrive at your airport US Immigration would NEVER allow such a thing to happenbr br WuMaster br br I got everything I wanted by going abroad You can too httpwwwhappierabroadcom
1	Scott Bartletts OffOn is nine minutes of pure craziness It is a fullfrontal assault of psychedelic pulsating epilepsyinducing flashing lights and colours and the first true merging of film and video in avantegarde cinema Theres no story to speak of but Bartlett uses images of nature  particularly the human face and form  to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions integrating these biological phenomena into the highlyindustrial form of modern technology In a sense the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools his machinery his technology This theme connects loosely with the subplot of HAL9000 in Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968 and indeed Bartletts opening sequence of images  flashing colours before a closeup human eye  recalls Dave Bowmans journey through the Stargate The visuals are richlycoloured a confronting blend of sharp vivid photography and increasinglygrainy video as though were sitting too close to a television screen as a matter of fact the end product was recorded from a TV monitorbr br There appears to be some confusion about the films release date IMDb lists the film as a 1972 release but both the National Film Registry and the National Film Preservation Foundation give 1968 as the correct year Perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the films completion and its first public screening Either way the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video and some brisk techno music wouldnt have gone amiss either OffOn captures grainy fragmented images presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information I had a thought  and please dont laugh at this freethinking interpretation  that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing Earths television signals might very well receive such a disjointed alien documentation of human life a bizarre montage of only vaguelyfamiliar imagery that couldnt possibly make any coherent sense Perhaps this is where Mankind with all his technology is eventually heading towards an irreversible merging of film and video of purity and artificiality
0	Unfortunately I made a mistake and I paid 7 Euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie My pointsbr br Film is based on 2 thingsbr br 1 Ethnical point of View As it happens on most of the American Films the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about the Asian culture But unfortunately it is not enough Knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods doesnt make a person understand a culture For example shaving is the sign of clean life in Asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that Lebanese people are Christian Ok they got that and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arabic countries The main difference between eastern and western culture is we dont make ethnocentrism So we dont judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film br br 2 Sexual revolution of a girl There is nothing much to say about this Show me 10 girls which had these on their sexual awakening than I will say that I am wrongbr br I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre Please watch DrStrangelove and understand the meaning of black humor A black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it Where is the truth Where is the meaning about the movie
0	Let me give a quick summery of the film A rotten rude kid named Max stumbles upon a radio that contains Kazaam a rapping genie Like all genies he grants 3 wishes but being good natured also helps Max with his personal life as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime During all this Kazaam raps from time to time also showcasing Shaqs dismal rap skillsbr br This movie proves what we all know Athletes need to stick to sports I admit that it never looked like an Oscarworthy movie but EVERYTHING about this waste of film is horrible The characters are either unlikable or stupid the plot is not even worth mentioning the dialog is a joke and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem Hell even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam this movie would still be a joke I know that the movie only drew ANYBODY was because Shaq was so big no pun intended at the time I honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time Shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws
1	If there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing The premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about However there is not much tension and Williams mild mannered portrayal doesnt do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boybr br Collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear The production felt rushed and holes are apparent It certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort The book is probably betterbr br One thing is certain Taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort

0	Terrible acting by Potter and a flat plot with no tension what so ever And as for the feminist polemic its laughable I saw this garbage when it was first released and though I found it tedious beyond belief Im glad I did go to see it Thats because I now have an immediate answer to the question whats the worst film youve ever seen Plus I have the comfort of knowing that every film I see for the rest of my life will be better than The Tango Lesson But I have to admit I was impressed with the way Potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum number of arts council grants from around the world as is revealed in the closing creditsbr br I only very recently saw Orlando and I can see how Potter learnt the wrong lessons from making that film All it took was a bunch of frilly costumes a few hard stares to camera by the leading lady and a loose plot to seduce the cinema going public So why shouldnt she think she could get away with the selfindulgent nothingness that is The Tango Lesson
1	In the voice over which begins the film HughieBilly Connolly a roadie for the great 70s band Strange Fruit said the reason lightning struck at a rock festival to stop Strange Fruits set was that God was sick of 70s excess Indeed its been popular to put down that era of music and see punk as a welcome antidote to it While I agree the excess was tiresomeas well as the misogynistic urges which came out of it and like punk I still am a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock and this film about Strange Fruits long strange reunion is an affectionate tribute to those daysbr br One of the reasons the film works is the care of the people behind the scenes Brian Gibson directed WHATS LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT about Tina Turnerwhile I had problems with the dramatic parts of the film the music was handled very well writers Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais cowrote THE COMMITMENTS and were behind the musicoriented British TV show OVER THE RAINBOW and the songs Strange Fruit played were cowritten by Foreigners Mick Jonesnot to be confused with The Clashs Mick Jones so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about Also two cast members are musicians in their own rightBill Nye I dont know about though the film credits him with his own singing and he certainly looks like a lead singer of that era while Jimmy Nail was in another British TV show which was musicoriented though I forget the name and he was in EVITA and the others are convincing at it And while as I said a lot of 70s bands like Strange Fruit behaved badly towards women the movie doesnt make the same mistakeexcept for the woman who follows Timothy Spall around as the manager of the reunion Juliet Aubrey is quite good and plays a fully rounded characterbr br The other actors are all good as well with special praise to Stephen Rea who handles the more dramatic role well without sentimentality There are a couple of plot points which dont work but overall this is quite enjoyable Oh yeah and the music is good too
0	Superman II The Richard Donner Cut should be a fans dream come true At long last footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life A director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored It seems like a winning situation And then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this esoteric dream is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence While its entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project And it is only a very few timesbr br You know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics But then we start seeing new footage alternates from Superman The Movie for the trial and that first bit of hesitation fades away Hey this is pretty neat Things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from STM intermixed with new effects for this project and it doesnt convince at all And from this point on it never ever lets up Its probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was Youll Believe A Man Can Fly its difficult to believe anything shown on screen here The best effects in this are from the original productionsbr br Another issue with this recut A lot of it just doesnt make sense The only reason any of it really works is because weve all seen the theatrical version of Superman II a movie that does make sense Lesters Superman II fills in the holes of this assembly Part of this could be because Donner didnt get to complete shooting the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little Lester material as possible What we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes Superman IV look airtight and coherentbr br After viewing this one gets the sense that while Lester was faithful and comfortable using Donner material Michael Thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by Lester The best scenes in The Donner Cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of Superman II That includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence not ironically both were filmed by Donner But anything else from that movie filmed by Lester is reedited in such a hasty fashion that it now makes Lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing While Lester honored the Donner material Lester here is thrown under the busbr br So is there anything good in this release Well Marlon Brando is in it and thats neat to see In fact watching any of the material shot by Donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as Superman The Movie But that only highlights the problems of this release Any of the major scenes really just Lois jumping and scenes with Marlon Brando would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section Instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used sloppy edits and bad decisionsbr br Watch the opening scene at the Daily Planet Why are we looking at Jackie Coopers back as he calls for Lois and Clark At the end why do we have Lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by Jackie Cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on I was initially confused by this because I expected to see Lois The entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like thisbr br Battle scenes are a mess too with no geography between cuts Its just random action Of course the major action scenes were shot by Lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of Donner outtakes or alternates They should have used more of Lesters footage but probably had too much pride to admit thatbr br The sloppiness extends to the military missile as well As noted elsewhere the missile shown in The Donner Cut bears the designation XK 10 while we all know its the XK 101 A blind man in STM knows that The producers of this assembly who tried so hard to honor the original film dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production For all the supposed care that was put into this the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapablebr br The entire affair would probably be easier to digest if Warners didnt make this a separate release here in the states As it is were expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a Play All option Its really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes but after that initial viewing I expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else I know after my experience of watching this I had new respect for Lesters version Its by no means perfect but Lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief He managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so while this new recut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history
1	I saw it last night on TV and was quite delighted br br It is sort of the movie which makes you feel nice and warm around heart and believe that there is still some goodness in the world all the neighbours pretended not to see what grace was doing in order to help her and protect her the old policeman is my favourite although you know that this story is not quite realisticbr br I loved acting they all seemed just as ordinary common people living in small picturesque English coast town but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has Just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their teabr br Perhaps the ending was a little bit confusing but it didnt stop me from really really enjoying the whole story
1	Without Kirsten Miller this project neednt have been completed However with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is Miss Miller I would definitely recommend it It looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance Wagners dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing but his few scenes didnt detract from being entertained Mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster The charismatic Miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable She plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be I wish I had seen this on the big screen but alas I was fortunate to rent it before it was lost
0	Did I step in something or is that bad smell coming from Daybreak 1 2 God was behind everything What has God got to do with SciFi God is only the answer when you cant think up a sensible explanation for something In fact this is exactly the problem with the series finale they obviously couldnt think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how Kara Thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper how her old viper and charred body ended up on Earth 2 why Baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head why 6 has an imaginary Baltar in her head etc so they explain it with angels or just dont explain it at allbr br The plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a Basestar through For example why does Galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl Hera particularly after Adama said there was no way hed attempt a rescue Because they found out the location of the Cylon base Thats not a good reason to sacrifice the crews lives And how did Anders know the location And what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters lives before the war Its like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last momentbr br The people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series Feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical Christians on a mission to spread The Word Forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot the important message the writers wanted to get across is dont put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction God is your ultimate salvation tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatmentbr br Imagine in the final movie of the Star Wars series they tell you there is no force instead a Jedi actually gets his power from Jesus Then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the Ewoks Would this be a good ending No it frakken wouldnt

0	I can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is I was sold on the promise of action with Segal and stealth aircraft which normally make for an entertaining action movie I can honestly say Id rather gouge my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again The acting was so awful that it was almost funny The story was insanely weak with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an F117 through them The script was so poor if I found out that a 10 year old wrote it I shouldnt be in the least surprised The direction and production is so amateur I wouldnt even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video Utter Utter drivel Those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art and they should be ashamed of themselves Steven Segal should never ever show his face in public again I cant imagine what made him agree to star in this the worst film I have seen in my entire life

1	There is no denying that Ealing comedies are good but for me this film stands out as one of the bestbr br The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy not the UK We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law rationing does not exist When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the systembr br They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started thats where the moral comes in Its when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender only to have the whole of London respond to their plight by sending food lots of it Thus enabling them to continue their strugglebr br This film hits the right note throughout the acting is superb with Stanley Holloway Margaret Rutherford Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out Its pitched just right not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat Well worth a viewing
0	Im not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and theres almost no plot anyway Ive seen several reviewers call ISOYG an antirape film or even a feminist statement and I just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claimsbr br First of all what do we see on the cover of this movie Thats right a shapely womans behind Whether it was Zarchis attempt to make an antirape statement and I absolutely dont believe it was is entirely beside the point The film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic everything but actual penetration is shown that NO ONE but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy itbr br The rapes in the film is uncomfortable brutal and hard to watch Theres something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes none There was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed mere moments before hes murdered so the scene isnt at all engaging on an emotional level Really its just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies ISOYG is associated with on IMDb Caligula Cannibal Ferox etc that it attracts only the exploitation crowdbr br Finally a few reviewers have commended Zarchis socalled documentary style and lack of a soundtrack But considering how inept everything else in the film is acting script etc I suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porncaliber actors do their thingbr br Im not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of ISOYG Im all for exploitation horror and love video nasties In fact Im giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films However its also poorly made and after the rape occurs just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of hohum mostly goreless murders and wait for the credits to rollbr br This is probably worth watching once if youre a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but Im telling you the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation
0	Ouch This one was a bit painful to sit through It has a cute and amusing premise but it all goes to hell from there Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying and he does not disappoint in this one Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville turned in surprisingly decent performances Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly among others played it way over the top I know thats the way the parts were written and its hard to blame actors when the script and director have them do such schlock If youre going to have outrageous characters thats OK but you gotta have good material to make it work It didnt here Run away screaming from this movie if at all possible

0	The movie is basically the story of a Russian prostitutes return to her home village for the funeral of a sisterfriend There are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken but they are not fully explored The core of the movie is the funeral wake and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable Apparently the movie is unedited The prostitutes journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud Maybe thats supposed to impress us with the immensity of the Russian landscape The village itself such as it is is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male the consort of the dead girl Continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible Most of the film is shot with a handheld camera that could induce nausea Another problem for Western viewers is that subtitles dont include the songs and laments of the crones Dont go to this movie unless youre fluent in Russian
1	Bruce Almighty is the best Jim Carrey work since The Truman Show and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent Hey Hollywood look how good I can act box office disappointments Its great to see Jim recognizing and embracing his strengths He wont get an Academy Award but the film itself will last longer than many of the awarded films of the Academy He is at the top of his form in this most recent film its like the return of an old friendbr br Carrey Freeman and Aniston all do a great job together comfortable in their comedy roles superb comic timing and obviously having fun together but without the hey mom look how funny I am type of comedy A real surprise was Steven Carrell as Carreys nemesis Carrell of The Daily Show fame who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film I laughed harder at Carell than anyone else in the past three yearsbr br I can foresee the religious nuts in the US will be upinarms over the treatment of God but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will Without Married With Children t o complain about this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities who know the types men adorned in gold watches on Sunday morning and late nigh television selling prayers to God And again about 05 of the country will care and 80 of the media will report itbr br The bottom line this a purely entertaining film each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do and a feelgood feeling at the movie conclusion A walk down any major street in America has to confirm that God has a tremendous sense of humor What better comic genius to remind us of that than Jim Carrybr br Thanks again Jim its GREAT to have you back
1	A wonder One of the best musicals ever The three Busby Berkely numbers that end the movie are spectacular but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible nonstop patter and the natural acting of Cagney and Blondell Keeler is also lovely even though she may not have been a great actress Theres a freshness in the movie that you dont see in flicks today much less in the usually stilted 30s films even though the plot involving the setting up of movies prologues is quite dated
0	Nothing happensbr br Then characters with no personality dont developbr br Then the end never comes because theres no beginning and no middlebr br There are beautiful shots that are made not beautiful because they arent even allowed to be because this movie isnt even THERE Theres no is in this movie because theres no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialog or point Theres nothing br br There is a good point it has a good soundtrack But the sound editing is such and the movie proper is such that watching it isnt even worth your time so if youre really interested Id suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something Youll get everything you can from this movie without all the fatigue headache and impatiencebr br PolarisDiB
0	This must be one of the worst movies Ive ever seen the graphics are ridiculous and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection processbr br I like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie so I cant say Im picky I have been struggling to find something to compare it to but I just cant think of anything that matches this maybe starship troopers 2 Witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my DVD player but compared to this its effects are great The acting superb and the script should be awarded You know when a movie is bad in a funny way well folks this isnt one of those this kills your soul minute by minute
0	This movie has a few things going for it right off the bat Having Dani Filth as a lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie Admittedly I love Cradle of Filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before I watched it Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead The independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor There are some GORGEOUS actresses in this movie For being low budget the special effects werent bad either The ways that people died were very creative and nightmarishbr br Now on to the cons There is VERY little talking throughout this whole movie thus making for very little as far as character development Its hard to fear for the lives of limp static characters When there was a little talking the F bomb was abundant popping up in random places Yes I understand people swear but it seems like a preteen boy scripted this and thought himself cool for including all the language The storyline what I could make out of it was pretty good although many parts are left dangling and the lack of conversation leaves one often wondering whats happeningbr br In the end Cradle of Fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence but like a porno trying to pull of a storyline it just doesnt work too well Rent it though if youre a morbid person looking to sate your blood and flesh appetite
0	I saw this movie as a very young girl Im 27 now and it scared me witless for years I had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to obviously the violence My parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie I think they only say that knowing that I have such strong feelings about it 0 I am currently reading the book out of morbid curiosity and the fact that its a classic and it is really a great story However I dont think that it should have been made into a cartoon Ever Well maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and I still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way Gives me a little heart palpitation every time Yah I am a wuss but I strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they approve of the content Not everyone finds it as disturbing as I did but we are out there 0
1	This film deals with the atrocity in Derry 30 years ago which is commonly known as Bloody Sundaybr br The film is well researched acted and directed It is as close to the truth as we will get until the outcome of the Saville enquiry The film puts the atrocity into context of the time It also shows the savagery of the soldiers on the day of the atrocity The disgraceful whitewash that was the Widgery Tribunal is also dealt withbr br Overall this is an excellent drama which is moving and shocking When the Saville report comes out watch this film again to see how close to the truth it is
0	This movie was by far the worst movie that I have ever seen in my entire life Im not even kidding It was poorly made and the actors couldnt act It was a waste of my time and money It looked like a movie that my friends and I could have put together on our own The case the movie came in is definitely a disguise Nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case It appears that the director or makeup artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie The credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie Which watching the credits was the best part of the movie This was honestly an awful movie and I couldnt believe how badly it was put together Scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like whats going on The audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teens joking around making a fake fight scenebr br IF you are considering renting or buying this movie I would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it shows how awful it truly is I wish i would have watched it before i rented it
0	Dull cheap scifi thriller made with an almost total lack of conviction a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from outer space is run by only ONE MAN and is VERY poorly guarded at night and full of campy sound effects Christopher Lee is not only wasted but he also gives one of his few Im here strictly for the money performances 12
1	I commend pictures that try something different Many films just seem like retreads of old ideas so that is the big reason I so strongly recommend Passport to Pimlicobr br The movie is set just after WW2 and the postwar shortages and rationing seem to be driving Londoners barmy The film centers on a tiny neighborhood in London called Pimlico They too are sick of not being able to buy what they want but can see no way out of it That is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter which officially named this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago With this document they reason they can bypass all the rationing and coupons and live life just as they want since it turns out they really ARENT British subjects Where the movie goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something youll need to see for yourselves Leave it up the brilliant minds of Ealing Studios to come up with this gem
1	all i have to say is if you dont like it then there is something wrong with you plus Jessica is just all kinds of hot the only reason you may not like it is because it is set in the future where Seattle has gone to hell that and you my not like it cause the future they show could very well happen
1	I just watched this movie for the second time and enjoyed it as much as the first time It is a very emotional and beautiful movie with good acting and great family values Inspiring and touching
1	I was really excited about seeing this film I thought finally Australia had made a good film but I was wrongbr br This was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever I feel sorry for Molly Ringwald having to come all the way to Australia to make an awful moviebr br The acting was terrible especially that Australian guy who was trying to speak in an American accent and the plot was also pretty badbr br When I first heard about this film coming out I thought that the title was pathetic because it sounds like the cheesy film Stab in Scream 2 but I was willing to let it slide if it was a good moviebr br WARNING MAJOR SPOILERSbr br Probably the worst thing about the film was the ending I was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was but the killer wasnt even human which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror moviebr br Dont see this film youll probably be disappointed

0	A wornout plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case the equally wornout plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut outbr br With such an outstanding case one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins But scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity no character arcs and inexplicable behaviorbr br The homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary or on the other hand completely unexplored It seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers When will Hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picturebr br A regrettably dreadful movie When will Lauren Bacall pick a good one I expected better of her and Kristin Scott Thomas This one is definitely one to miss

0	I saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless An ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas The victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man They drop their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off orduh burn him Quentin alias Mr Fabersham of the Honeymooners is married to Diane Brewster alias Miss Canfield of Leave it to Beaver fame who is unhappy in marriage Wow love plot The rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and wait for screams to react and run to their aid The Egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film Where is the mummy Really just a curse unleashed This does not hold a torch to Universal Mummy films in the leastWatch this movie if you need sleep because you will dose off

1	I found Still Crazy to be marvelously entertaining and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late 60s early 70s rock My 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time I drag out the DVD dont worry its only been three times and she loves it toobr br It is a truly loving poignant and hilarious nod to the era and every actor hits hisher notes with perfection It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am glad his somewhat similar turn in Love Actually brought him more attention Bruce Robinson was incredible as Brian bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drugdamaged rocker stereotype It was interesting to see that Robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writerbr br I live in Sherman Oaks California and after the first time I saw the movie I bumped into Billy Connolly at the local mall he lived here at the time and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time He invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time We even talked of the idea of an Americanoriented remake before wisely dismissing that Why mess with the originalbr br My only problem with Still Crazy is that it wasnt hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience
0	Hollywoods misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits For every Godfather II there are dozens of More American Graffitis Stayin Alives and Grease 2s While the original Grease is not a great film the 1977 adaptation of the longrunning Broadway hit does have songs evocative of the 1960s energetic choreography and an appealing cast When Paramount began work on a followup the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbusterbr br Fortunately for moviegoers Michelle Pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts Her talent and beauty were already evident herein and Pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform Maxwell Caulfield however lacks even the skill to express embarrassment and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic What romantic interest beyond hormones could the cool sassy Pfeiffer have in the deadpan Caulfield That dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory Only cameos by veterans such as Eve Arden Connie Stevens and Sid Caesar have any wit although Lorna Luft does rise slightly above the lame materialbr br Reviewers have complained that because Grease 2 is always compared to the original the movie comes up lacking However even taken on its own terms the film is a clunker After a frenetic opening number which evidently exhausted the entire cast the energy dissipates With few exceptions the original songs bear little resemblance to the early 1960s and the only nostalgia evoked is for Our Miss Brooks and Sid Caesars Comedy Hour The jokes fall flat and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer Patricia Birch is clumsy to be polite However worse films have been inflicted on audiences and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters Unfortunately Grease 2 is not even unintentionally funny Instead the film holds the viewers attention like a bad train wreck Just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered the next scene plunges into even worse carnage
0	I dont think anyone sitting down to view this film would be expecting anything remotely appearing like a classic ghost story but you have to ask yourself when its over if you were ever scared This doesnt really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film doesnt tack on one of those happy endings Story is about an American couple who travel to Kyoto Japan so that Ted Fletcher Edward Albert can write a book and he brings along his wife Laura Susan George and their daughter Amy Amy Barrett Their friend Alex Curtis Doug McClure who works at the American Consulate helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted About 140 years earlier in the same house a Samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide Their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the Fletchers arrive it doesnt take long before strange things start happeningbr br SPOILER ALERTbr br At times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the Fletchers and they start to act like the Japanese people that they were before and Laura starts to flirt with Alex which leads to an affair Meanwhile Ted starts behaving more strict and after he pours soup down the throat of Amy he goes to ask a Monk for help Unfortunately the ghosts get Ted Laura and Alex to play out their death scene like it happened 140 years earlierbr br This film was directed by Kevin Connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with McClure on some of them While this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that I liked First it doesnt have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after defeating the demons Instead it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghosts Secondly it has Susan George in the cast Ive always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch Also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she doesnt have classic features she does have a unique tomboy like look about her and its one of the reasons why she was so popular But after appearing in silly films such as this I think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically This isnt a bad film but its never convincing and watching the ghosts scurry around when the Monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a giggle or two The bottom line is that this is silly and I hope George decides to resume her career

0	The only reason I give it a 2 is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment onbr br This film is asinine Its like so many other 21st century grind house fodder The gore is gratuitous and simply revolting I didnt care about any of the characters but I did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap Id complain about the money I spent but my date and I wisely left after 40 minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining Live Free or Die Hard which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because I endured the utter poop of Captivity for 40 minutes

1	This is actually a trilogy of 3 of Somerset Maughams short tales The first one is The Verger which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable After 17 years Albert Foreman is laid off from his church job because he cant read nor write So what does he do Opens a tobacco shop of coursebr br The second is Mr KnowAll which was actually a story I had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten until I heard the familiar introduction Another 15 minute one and also very good It worked better on film than in a book for me but then perhaps thats because I was only 14 the last time afterallbr br The 3rd one is nearly a letdown Almost an hour in length it simply drags Its not all that bad but not as quick and snappy as the last 2 I watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour and found that it still made sense and really I hadnt missed a thingbr br Overall I give them 8 9 and 6 out of 10 respectively
1	I cant understand what it is that fans of the genre didnt like about this film It was truly a lot of fun The special effects were wonderful I generally agree with reviews and with IMDB voters but not this time I waited until it came to home video which I felt was another reason that I wouldnt enjoy the film I believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen but again this was not the case To me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time Blair Witch and The Mummy Both films that I thought were terrible Blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time The Mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck People liked it for its special effects Films like the Mummy and The Haunting are not rich in character development they are more like funhouse rides Well with that analogy the Mummy was a B ticket to the Hauntings Eticket
1	I get tired of my 4 and 5 year old daughters constantly being subjected to watch Nickelodeon Disney and the like It all seems to be the same old tired cartoons rehashed over and over again When my daughters couldnt go to the fair this afternoon because one of them was sick I wanted them to just relax and rest for a while I flipped the TV on and in searching for something different I flipped the channels My finger stopped channel surfing the moment I heard Harveys voice I adore every single solitary thing this man has done and when I saw that he was doing voiceover work for a little duck well I couldnt change the channel My daughters were instantly mesmerized by the cartoon and the more we watched the show TOGETHER the more I grew to love it along with the message that was being portrayed Its not necessarily a proponent for gay rights but rather for anyone who has ever been ostracized as a child for ANYTHING I had friends who were picked on for one thing or another too fat too skinny too feminine being a bully not being smart enough only having one parent you name it Kids as a rule can be very very cruel to one another so I was happy to see an entertaining cartoon that actually conveyed a LIFE MESSAGE to its audience My girls already accept others as they are and dont pick on others for being different My older daughter actually stands up for her friends if theyre picked on one happens to have a single Mom and that little girl is picked on quite often it warms my heart when Kassie stands up for herbr br So those of you who are condemning this show because you feel that its an advocate for gay rights or are being forced to accept certain views you clearly and completely missed the point of this poignant little cartoonbr br And if you need it explained to you well you need more help than any television show could ever offer
1	A thin story with many fine shots Eyecatchers here are the three ladies from the DREAM team And to a lesser extent the guy accompanying them Traci Lords convincingly acts out the female half of an evil businesscouple intending to poison the world with antrax Original in this movie is the brabomb put on a captured member of the DREAMteam Of course she is rescued by a comember three seconds before explosion Although clearly lent from James Bonds Goldfinger and You only live twice such a climax always works well All in all a nice watch James Bond replaced here by three Charlies Angels
0	I happened to love the show growing up along with millions of others So I tuned in to this movie thinking if not good it might be at least a bit dazzling and funbr br WRONG I just have to wonder at the end of this was Charlies Angels really that boring I dont seem to remember it as such But this movie as bad as movies of this type can be bore little resemblance to the excitement of that time period and show I did see it all in spite of the negatives it wasnt unwatchable But it was very bland which I do not fault the performers for at all particularly the women who played the angels as they really did look like them The movie just wasnt that interesting It tried to make each angel a character One angel is to feisty one is the good girl one is to into her husbandall characters were portrayed with one major characteristic defining them and little depth beyond stereotypes The excitement of the show was missing and the dialog wasdialog Thats pretty much itbr br Not awful Not the worst of TV movies But missable

0	The views of Earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by NASA have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of Apollo 11 and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the daybr br This would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the whole Earth picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft windowbr br I am waiting for Bart Sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by NASA though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map and the ones in private hands would still be a problembr br Ah a response Trying to discredit this movie by referring to NASA weather data Id say is a charming but weak and gullible argument What about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie A certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels Do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here This movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by US government that the moonmissions were a success and that man now are true masters of the universe Things are nearly never quite what they seem Just watch the movie and I dear say youll see things a bit different than beforebr br First off weather data doesnt come from NASA it comes for met agencies around the world Second the weather data undermines a major claim in the film Third far from being packed with irrefutable evidence the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked Sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film so he edited it and added his own interpretation Unfortunately for him his source film is public domain and the bits Sibrel edited out contradict his claims

0	First of all this film can be divided into three segments A promising opening with the ambushing of some cavalry by the Cheyenne This is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section with the totally miscast Candice Bergen and Soldier Blue traveling together to reach the safety of an Army garrison Miss Bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth and looks like she just walked out of a 1970s Jack Nicholson movie I mean she maintains zero interest with zero believability The third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an Indian village This is so obviously overdone to lay on the antiwar propaganda that it comes across as simply long outrageous and contrived Not recommended MERK Jacobe comment above Heres an idea Why dont you actually watch the movie you are commenting on instead of chirping your liberal nonsense This is not a political site it is for reviewing films MERK

1	If your idea of a thriller is car chases explosions and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire then House of Games is definitely not the movie for you If you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense then by all means see itbr br House of Games tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer Dr Margaret Ford Lindsay Crouse who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic Mike Joe Mantegna To say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense Frankly I find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming Just like a clever con artist this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilancebr br The story is taut and wellcrafted the dialogue smart and laconic the acting uniformly good Mantegna is superbly charismatic Some have complained that Dr Ford is not a very sympathetic character and wondered why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse look so physically unattractive But Dr Ford is supposed to be cold and aloof moreover her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot at one point I believe that an injury to her sexual selfesteem is a key part of her motivation Ill say no morebr br House of Games is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity It will hold your attention every second while you are watching and stay with you for a long time afterwards

1	This game is amazing Really you should get it if you dont have it Although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out I believe that this game will always be a classic Its just as good a Super Mario World or so When I was young my friend and I would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did Its not nearly as advanced as Super Mario Galaxy but if you are a fellow Mario fan it is essential Its fun entertaining and challenging Everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics well it did come out in 1996 ROCK ON 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI Nintendo is the best
0	I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial The commercial was great but it I found out later that it had every explosion or special effect in the entire movie about 4 and even some that werent in the movie There was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as I remember It was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to scam people I guess my world of innocence ended that day when I found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies

1	Mario Lanza of course is The Great Caruso in this 1951 film also starring Ann Blyth Dorothy Kirsten Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath This is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary worldrenowned tenor whose name is known even todaybr br The film is opulently produced and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by Lanza Kirsten Judmila Novotna Blanche Thebom and other opera stars who appeared in the film If youre a purist seeing people on stage smiling during the Sextet from Lucia will strike you as odd even if Carusos wife Dorothy just had a baby girl Also its highly unlikely that Caruso ever sang Edgardo in Lucia the role lay too high for himbr br In taking dramatic license the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of Carusos life What was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire yet this is never mentioned in the film These roles include Maurizio in Adriana Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson in Girl of the Golden West There is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga The reason for that photo His only shirt was in the laundry He was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the Victor TalkingMachine Company later RCA Victor He was singing Jose in Carmen in San Francisco the night of the earthquakebr br Instead the MGM story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of Martha which never happened He had a hemorrhage during LElisir damore at the Met and could not finish the performance he only sang three more times at the Met his last role as Eleazar in La Juive What killed him The same thing that killed Valentino peritonitis His first role at the Met was not Radames in Aida as indicated in the film but the Duke in Rigoletto So when it says on the screen suggested by Dorothy Carusos biography of her husband thats what it was suggested What is true is that Dorothys father disowned her after her marriage and left her 1 of his massive estate They also did have a daughter Gloria together who died at the age of 79 on 1072007 However Caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married Dorothybr br Some people say that Lanzas voice is remarkably like Carusos but just listen to Caruso sing in the film Match Point Carusos voice is remarkably unlike Lanzas In fact from his sound had he wanted to Caruso could have sung as a baritone He is thought to have had some trouble with high notes further evidence of baritone leanings and the role he was preparing when he died was Othello a dramatic tenor role which Lanza definitely was not Lanzas voice deserved not to be compared with another He made a unique contribution to film history popularizing operatic music He sings the music in The Great Caruso with a robust energy he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career His acting is natural and genuine Ann Blyth is lovely as Dorothy and gets to sing a little herselfbr br Really a film for opera lovers and Lanza fans which are probably one and the same
0	After the success of ScoobyDoo Where are You they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show But unfortunately they added a new character that spoilt ScoobyDoo success forever They invented a new show with a new title Scooby and ScrappyDoo It was ScrappyDoo that made this show a complete failure probably for both adults and kids together Scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up Scooby and Shaggy were getting scared of the villain and they were also trying to stop him ScoobyDoo doesnt need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews If they wanted ScoobyDoo to be more successful they should have either killed or never thought up Scrappy This was just poor maybe your kids will prefer it
0	That this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at Sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these daysbr br First of all there is such a thing as the art of cinematography Just picking up a 16mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real moviebr br I guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didnt pick up someones camcorderbr br Second indie films are supposed to be about real people Theres nothing real in this film None of the characters come across as being even remotely humanbr br What they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how cool and edgy he isbr br Sorry but this is not good writing or good directingbr br What is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to Sundance Hard to believe this was one of the best films submittedbr br In any case it made me loose what was left of my respect for the Sundance brand
1	This movie has an all star cast John Candy Richard Lewis Ornella Mutti Cybill Shepard and Jim Belushi to name a few run amuck in Monte Carlo as well as some other beautiful European locations and is very funny The trouble that everyone gets in when they lie to protect themselves is great and I highly recommend that you see this movie it is well worth it John Candy is in top form in Once Upon A Crime as is everyone else If you and your family are looking for a great family film this is your ticket Everyone gives stellar performances great acting great comedy and great timing which is rare in movies these days Great plot great mystery which I love anyways and overall well worth the money you spend on it So get the kids grab some popcorn juice or tea or sodas and enjoy the show
0	This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen Branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he couldnt deliver his lines The plot was definitely not worthy of John Grishams name No wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters I didnt even watch the whole thing I decided I didnt care who done it then realized there was no whodunit to care about
1	This movie has to be my favorite of all time Its not supposed to have a plot because its makers wanted people Charlie Sheen I thinkto believe it was a real snuff film This was an exercise in visual effects and doesnt cut away when the action happens like every other film does Movies these days are now all about sound effects leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with CGI blood There still are movie makers who still cant get fake blood to look like the real thing There is no rape scene because that wasnt the point of making the film Have you seen the hills have eyes 2 The rape scene was funny instead of shocking Although im sure there are some GONZO porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror But since they probably suck at making films they probably wouldnt be able to pull it off The movie Baise Moi has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucksbr br Its too bad that a movie cant be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all especially when talking about an AO or NC17 rating Im sure Eli Roth has the abilitytalent to make his Hostel film series much much better but he has too tame it down to get an R ratingor at least I hope that his movies sucked because of these limitationsbr br Watch Traces of Death or More than Smashed Pumpkins if you want no frills real footage accident crime scenesfootage Dont forget that this movie was made in 1985 The fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film That would be like someone saying the 8bit Super Mario Brothers sucks because the PS3 has better graphics
0	This movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time I generally like the cheap horror monster type movies but this movie was a disappointment The main flaw being the lack of explaining the creatures When they entered the house and found the man he could have at lease explained them He doesnt really say anything about them other than that they killed his parents and unless i missed something the didnt say how he managed to escape either Not to mention the fact that it gives no clue or reason why the only survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after her own near death experience It would have seemed that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the cross incident
1	The making of The Thief Of Bagdad is quite a story unto itself almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film Alexander Korda nearly went broke making this filmbr br According to the Citadel Film series Book about The Great British Films adopted son of the United Kingdom Alexander Korda had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation But World War II unfortunately caught up with Korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectaclebr br Budget costs happen in US films too only Cecil B DeMille always had a free hand at Paramount after 1932 when he returned there But DeMille nor any of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film Part of the way through the shoot Korda transported the whole company to America and shot those sequences with Rex Ingram as the genie in our Grand Canyon He certainly wasnt going to get scenery like that in the UK Korda also finished the interiors in Hollywood all in time for a release on Christmas Day 1940br br The spectacle of the thing earned The Thief Of Bagdad four Academy Award nominations and three Oscars for best color cinematography best artset direction for a color film and best special effects Only Miklos Roszas original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category Korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the Grand Canyon because its impossible to get bad color pictures from that placebr br The special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil The good is the two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez and the evil is Conrad Veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart both belonging to Duprez This was Veidts career role until Casablanca where he played the Luftwaffe major Stroesser br br Of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source Beggar boy and thief Sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star Literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the Maharajah of Mysore he was spotted by Alexander Korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features Sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the Arabian Nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant Not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at thatbr br The Thief Of Bagdad holds up remarkably well today Its an eternal tale of love romance and adventure in any order you want to put it
1	A message movie but a rather good one Outstanding cast top to bottom Interesting in that Bette Daviss plot line is essentially back story The extremely negative reviews name throwing at the screenplayplaywright associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about Angles in America etc etc object to the movie being too preachy about Germany in WWII Gosh that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for mebr br Theatrical and moviemaking and acting styles vary over time and of course 70 years later this particular movie would not be made in this way Yes Casablanca is a better movie I guess but although made in the same year and both having Nazis in them Casablanca is primarily a love story The love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plotmore of a thriller Both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors The children ARE a bit tedious and could have been edited
0	The First Power 1990 was a terrible film that came out during the late 80s early 90s era of cheaply made horror films I found this movie very boring but extremely hilarious in some parts This movie lacks so much sense and credibility that it aint even funny The swift justice system in this film makes Texas look weak by comparison Lou Diamond Phillips is in way over his head with this role he plays a hardboiled cop and Tracey Griffith Melanies more attractive sister plays a psychic Dont waste your time with this one because its bad What a minute I take it back This movie makes a great party film Check out the switchblade crucifix packing nun she has the nicest legs Ive ever seen on a Nun that wasnt in a Jesus Franco nunsploitation flick Yeowbr br This marked an end of an era for LDP His star was tarnished and he couldnt draw flies to a dung heap It was DTV for him until his ressurection a few years laterbr br Not recommended unless youre desperate
0	I didnt know if i would laugh or cry seeing this Only addicted fans of danni filth could have a taste for this This is supposed to be a horror movie but theres only filth in this The most cool scene is the car accident with real special effects from the best of hollywood Avoid this movie at all costs See this only for studies of how bad can be a movie
1	Upon the first viewing I found this tale to be at least less annoying than other Cannon Movie Tales After many more I think its one of the best Some of the songs are pretty bad especially the love song but two things stand out that make the movie even the singing worthwhile One is the art direction Like the other Cannon Movie Tales this is a beautifully decorated period piece every piece of cloth and jewel both of which have major parts in this movies plot look fresh and new and contrast with the plain clothes of the peasants Even during the love song I find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess wonderfully done The other thing is the comic timing A lot of the movie is cheesy but the emperors vanity and his making fun of himself in the end the suspicious guard the guard chasing Nicholas and the stupid prince were all quite funny and seem to be ridiculous quite on purpose And the sequence during the song WeaveO makes up for the songs that werent so good
0	Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to Italy tired of the Hollywood glamor treatment First it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in STROMBOLI an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress And now its EUROPA 51 another tedious exercise in soggy sentimentbr br Nor does the story do much for Alexander KNOX in another thankless role as her longsuffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son At least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than STROMBOLIbr br Bergman is still attractive here but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman Shes never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son despite attempts by a kindly male friend Sometimes I think Im going out of my mind she tells her husband A portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace but it does give us a sense of where the story is goingbr br Bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in postwar Rome but being a social worker with poor children doesnt improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worsebr br The films overall effect is that its not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like Bergman The film loses pace midway through the story as Bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that shes twotiming him The story goes downhill from there after she nurses a streetwalker through her terminal illness The final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylumbr br Ingrid suffers nobly through it all overcompensating for the loss of her son but its no use Not one of her best flicks to put it mildlybr br Trivia note If she wanted neorealism with mental illness she might have been better off accepting the lead in THE SNAKE PIT when it was offered to her by director Anatole Litvak It would have done more for her career than EUROPA 51br br Summing up Another bleak indiscretion of Rossellini and Bergman
1	I saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was Well that was because it isnt supposed to be taken so seriously basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job There seems to be another movie coming out like that too umm Scary Movie Well this is Aussie and original Jessica Napier does a surperb performance and Sarah Kants has a definate bright future in acting I hope to see more of them Molly Ringwald was a good move and Kylie was an even better move The Impossible Princess was Queen of the screen I recommend seeing this flick as youll be guessing until the very end the connection with Raffy Hilary and The movie that never got finished 20 years ago
1	Heres my first David Mamet directed film Fitting since it was his first as well br br The story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie from the little cons to the big cons to the allencompassing con Its like The Grifters but without that films level of acting In that film John Cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character The acting here is very flat I sometimes wondered if the bland acting by Crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis At least in the beginning It never gets really good but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes Early in the film some of Lindsay Crouses lines the way she reads them sound as if theyre inner monologue or narration which they arent With the arrival of Mantegna things pick upbr br The dialogue here isnt as fun as it should be I was expecting crackerjack ringadingding lines that roll off the tongue but these ones dont It all sounds very read rather than spoken Maybe Mamet evolved after this film and loosened up but if not then maybe he should let others direct his words Hes far too precious with them here and as a result they lose their rhythmic jazzy quality Whats more strange is that other than this the film doesnt look or feel like a play The camera is very cinematic My only problem with Glengarry Glen Ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre but in that film the actors were not only accomplished but relaxed and free Everything flowedbr br I wouldnt mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines or even play characters speaking play lines but here it sounds like movie or even book characters speaking play lines Its a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesnt work That doesnt mean the movie is bad it isnt its often extremely entertaining The best chunk is in the middlebr br Its standard con movie stuff the new guy in this case girl Margaret Ford Lindsay Crouse gets involved in the seedy con underworld How she gets involved is shes a psychiatrist and one of her patients Billy is a compulsive gambler She wants to help him out with his gambling debt so she walks into The House of Games a dingy game room where con men work in a back room Ill admit the setup is pretty improbable Were they just expecting Crouse to come in Were they expecting shed write a cheque Was Billy in on it One of these questions is definitely answered by the end howeverbr br And from here the cons are start to roll out I found the beginning ones the little learner ones to be the most fun Were getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as Crouse is br br We see the ending coming and then we didnt see the second ending coming and then the real ending I didnt see coming but maybe you did The ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second Crouse walked into The House of Games she found her true callingbr br Im going to forgive the annoying opening the improbable bits and the strange linereading because there are many good things here If the first part of the movie seems stagy stick with it After the halfhour mark it does really get a momentum going If you want a fun con movie then here she is If you want Mamet go watch Glengarry Glen Ross again James Foley did him betterbr br
0	i tried to sit through this bomb not too long agowhat a disaster the acting was atrociousthere were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloonthis was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didnt ring truesupposedly a modern reworking of the Hitchcock original Lifeboati think Hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of itfrom what i was able to suffer throughthere is nothing compelling in this movieit boasts a few semi big namesbut they put no effort into their charactersbutyou knowto be fairit was nobodys fault reallyi meanim pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion LOLit is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes alongbut for meim not willing to spend at least three days to find outso unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizonavoid this stinker 110
0	From the start this film was awful Why was it that bad If it isnt the naked women not only in need of a decent plastic surgeon but also the expertise of a dentist followed by a free hand out of Colgate whitening Then its the crazy old guy at the gas station who isnt so much crazy but more Im not sure how to act a great deal so I will stare straight ahead and look as stupid as I can while pretending to shout in robotic tones about something in the woods Then back to these naked nymphs in need of a cure for gingivitis apparently without touching youand this is according to the opening scene they can cause a nasty looking red rash on your neck which I assumed to be a chunk of flesh missing but just looks as though it could do with some TCP to clear it right up Then you have Sophie Holland who plays Ally I have never seen such baaaaaad acting she is more of a me me me if Im not having fun noone else is and I dont wanna do this so I wont and Im the meanest cow on the planet Im sarcastic petty and if I dont get things my way I will sulk kind of person reminds me more of a 6 yr old girls attitude I dont think its even worth mentioning the dire camera angles that remind me of Blair Witch or how lowbudget the film actually was that when Judd was hacking at the locked door it was in fact open before he reached to unlock it from the other side This film is completely laughable If it were a spoof then it would have been successfulonly just though but as a horror film is was just plain wrong I cant even being to describe everything that went tts up in this movie I would run out of room Although it was funny to watch Andrew drip raspberry juice in his ear every time he opened his mouth while Tom Savinis character was completely blind to the two hiding under the table directly in his line of vision It was even funnier when these two thought they could escape on a god damn tractor which as we all know is thee number one hated vehicle to get stuck behind since its so god damn slow So is it any wonder they dont get away with it And how many people do you know that can slice open their wrist and then run around for hours as if nothing ever happened No pain no weakening from blood loss nothing But the silliest part is when all of a sudden and i mean that literally its one YEAR later and Molly is still wandering the woods after having escaped the nymphs and then lo and behold Shaun Hutson picks her upof course not without a line to promote his books altho admittedly he is one of my fav authors but suddenly and with absolutely no hint of an xplanation as to how and why shes evil herself and lures Hutson to his death then we cut to the crazy dude from the beginning suddenly wandering round the woods with a petrol can even after his dazzling performance on why noone should ever venture there for whatever reasoncue the nymphs stupidly slappin each other around a bit for fun while Crazy pours petrol everywhereand here endeth the filmfinally My conclusionif you hadnt already guessed by nowabsolute rubbish There was no proper thought went into it at all whoever was aiming the camera needed firingand come to think of it so did 99 of the cast If the right director actors and budget got behind this it could have been decent But once again lowbudget English horror films but the rest of the genre the country and the English filmmaking industry to shame And Im English so Im allowed to say that In fact the only decent and exciting part of the movie is in the first 1520 mins when we watch it turn from night to day over a field type area All I kept thinking throughout this was Jesus Christ in heaven why oh why did you allow someone to make this its absolute cows testicles But I cant turn a film off after Ive started watching it unfortunately I had to watch From Dusk Til Dawn afterwards just to remind myself that Tom Savini does have it in him to act well If there was an option for 010 then believe me I woulda chose that cuz this film isnt even worth the one point I did give it br br But this is just my opinion watch it and decide for yourself
0	I hate to sound like an old person but frankly I havent seen too many movies that I like that were made after 1960 generally movies just seem to get worse and worse although I quite enjoyed the Scott Baio vehicle The Bread My Sweet except for the de rigeur sex scene which added NOTHING of value to THAT movie This movie makes the mother a former Las Vegas chorus girl seem to be incapable of surviving on her own although she is clearly in her 50s though hinted at being in her 40s I didnt buy it Im 57 and like all the women I know in their 50s and 40s more than capable of surviving on my own as I have been doing since I graduated from high school at 13 got legally emancipated and set off on my own lifes journey br br The daughter is not believable in her job role she gets a promotion she doesnt deserve a great opportunity and drops that ball too but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver the writers shoot her down as an opportunist when she was just doing what any careeroriented person would do taking advantage of a wideopen opportunity created by the lack of selfdiscipline of her coworker a girl who apparently doesnt understand the concept of honoring her promises to her boss in this casebr br The daughter grudgingly allows her mother to stay with her on a temporary basis but then treats her mother the woman who gave her Life and raised her to adulthood like a pariah Apparently the writers of tripe like this do not understand that it is NOT the common thing for PARENTS to act like children and then be treated AS children by THEIR children That is just more of the societal baloney that Hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we their public were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offeringsbr br This is a sad movie with a stupid ending If the young male restauranteur had been real and not a twodimensional tv character hed have stayed with the MOTHER who was not that much older than him and quite attractive But in the end he falls for the daughter a shallow rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth but in an ordinary bland way The opportunist young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive physicallybr br There was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter who was an uptight selfish selfcentered btch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect to the mother a woman who was kindhearted sweettempered humorous and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend Of course the mother had her own flaws she had reacted to her husbands demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughterbr br Regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually LIKE baloney Wheres the mustard
1	The Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the Depression following almost ruined the American Musical Theater in fact it was the final death blow to vaudeville Those behind the curtains were hit as bad as those in frontbr br In an effort to stimulate the show business economy and his own personal economy out of work theater director James Cagney comes up with a brilliant idea Stage live relevant prologues to the movies that are being shown at the various movie theaters that are springing up overnight from the old theaters Some other competitors get wind of it and the competition is onbr br Footlight Parade is my favorite Busby Berkeley film It gives James Cagney a chance to display some of his versatility as a dancer as well as a tough guy In his retirement Cagney said that while he screened his few and far between musicals a lot he could barely be bothered with some of his straight dramatic films He wished hed done a few more musicals in his career and I wish he hadbr br Of course the staging of these Busby Berkeley extravaganzas on the stage of a movie palace defies all logic and reason But its so creative and fun to watch br br Dick Powell gets to sing three songs in Footlight Parade Ah the Moon is Here Honeymoon Hotel and By a Waterfall the last two with Ruby Keeler further cementing that screen team Ruby sings and dances with Powell in the last two and she partners with James Cagney in my favorite number from Footlight Parade Shanghai Lil br br Joan Blondell is Cagneys no nonsense girl Friday at the theater Like in Blonde Crazy shes the one with the real brains in that duo and its her quick thinking that bails him out of some domestic problems he has on top of his theatrical ones One of Blondells best screen rolesbr br Look for Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern in the chorus as per the IMDb pages for both of them John Garfield is seen briefly in the Shanghai Lil number And in a scene at the beginning of the film producer Guy Kibbee takes Cagney to a movie theater where they are showing a B western starring John Wayne The Dukes voice is unmistakable But whats even more unusual is that the brief clip shows him in a scene with Frank McHugh who plays another Cagney assistant in Footlight Parade I think the brothers Warner were playing a little joke there Ive got to believe that clip was deliberatebr br Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley at his surreal best

1	I admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of hisher reluctant guardian Ive seen enough of them  Baby Boom Kolya About a Boy Mostly Martha and to some extent Whale Rider  to expect to be bored by the formula What held my attention in The King of Masks was the grimness of the setting smalltown China in the 1930s Extreme poverty was the norm and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market When Wang discovers his purchased grandson whom hes nicknamed Doggie is a granddaughter he initially casts her out even though shes showed great promise as streetperforming heir Even after he reluctantly takes her back hes not too upset when shes kidnapped The film is gritty then showing the lengths to which a young streetsmart girl had to go to survive in that societybr br The two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context In a Western society one would expect at least a hint of resentment from Wang at not having achieved more material success Wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status though that I did too While Doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern suburban child its completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage And after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her her fierce attachment to Wang makes perfect sensebr br The peek at smalltown life in a foreign country the naturalness of the two lead actors the surprising plot twists and of course the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film

1	A friend of mine recommended this movie citing my vocal and inflective similarities with Des Howl the movies main character I guess to an extent I can see that and perhaps a bit more Im not very sure whether or not thats flattering portrayalbr br This is a pretty unique work the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be True Romance not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue Whale Music is just so much more well relaxed But instead that they both represent modern love storiesbr br In general Im a big fan of Canadian movies about music and musicians for example I highly recommend Hard Core Logo and this film in particular It has an innocent charm Des is not always the most likeably guy but theres something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy
1	This film was shot on location in Gerard Gardens in Liverpool and was the UKs answer to films such as Blackboard Jungle The film stands the test of time quite well with all the moral stories still or even more relevant today The film feature some fine performance from some notable British actors such as David McCallum Stanley Baker Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood Baker plays a Liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age they will end up being responsible adultsbr br Notable cameos in the film include Freddie Starr Fred Fowell and Melvyn Hayes Gloria Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play brother and sister they are real life brother and sister who are caught up in an arsonists web Tsai Chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest Nicole Kidman film The Interpretorbr br Violent Playground features a gun siege in a school so is unlikely to be shown on TV following similar events in Scotland Russiabr br I lived in Gerard Gardens where the film was shot though was not born at the time and have fond memories of the area I have recently completed a documentary on Gerard Gardens which includes extracts from Violent Playground and a small UK film Coast to Coast which stars Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite The tenements were demolished in 1987 and the films go some way in keeping the memory alivebr br There were some complaints from the residents when the film was released as the film portrayed the area in a bad light Time has helped heal those woundsbr br A little gem of a film I would recommend you seek this out
1	This film has a clear storyline which is quite unusual to the musical genre Cats Phantom of the Opera and other Andrew Lloyd Webbers musicals can be considered metaphorical as they use literary works as their framework Biarkan Bintang Menari BBMs storyline touches the very core of human relationships especially that of Indonesian people Despite the fact the film was based on a supposedly fairytale its actually a fantasy of the child in Indonesian adults The dance sequences are not perfect yet the songs represent how Indonesians express themselves I reckon the choreographer should explore Indonesian way of dancing by not dismaying the fact that Indonesias dance development tends to be more westernized The dance sequences seem awkward in some ways and not synchronized with the songs andor music Yet I still love this movie and regard it as a new wave of Indonesian film genre which I hope to improve in the future
1	IMDb lists this as 1972 for some reason but the other sources Ive seen including the excellent program notes mark it as 68 Doesnt really matter except that its quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video one of the first art works to merge the two apparently in the context of the Star Gate sequence in 2001 released the same year Pure abstraction isnt really my thing but I can take it in small doses and the supersaturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers Rohrschach blots birds etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful Certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s and deserves to be better known
1	One of the most heartwarming foreign films Ive ever seenbr br The young girl is an amazing talent Stellar performances by her Doggie the old man the king of masks and Liang the Living Boddhisatvabr br SPOILER The deplorable treatment of children especially females is disturbingbr br Loved the music The original Chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the storybr br This is a MUST SEE enjoyable family film although not for very young children Would have rated the DVD release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the DVD and the transfer had included the widescreen version
1	Next to Star Wars and The Wizard of Oz this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made Its a true shame its not as wellknown as the former films maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or scifi settings and that its British meaning a smaller market for films but its wonderful to know that its deserved that reputationbr br Like all great family films one can be a child an adult or even a teenager to enjoy this film Im currently 18 but one must appreciate classic films first I absolutely adore this film It has an extraordinary music score by Miklos Rozsa perhaps my favorite classic film score that rivals any John Williams Star Wars score a fast but not flashy pace beautiful sets dialog and use of color both the sets and cinematography won Oscars and stateoftheart Oscarwinning special effects for the time and some are still stunning And of course June Duprezs sultry looks as the Princess rivals that of Catherine ZetaJones she even looks like Jones in a waybr br In conclusion this is one of my alltime favorite movie next to The Adventures of Robin Hood and it truly deserves more attention It is a true adventure of enchantment throughout and along with Robin Hood its my desert island film that I could watch over and over again without getting annoyedbr br Stars excellent

1	Having read some of the other comments here I was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised REALITY CHECK The original series wasnt that good I think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and Daisy Dukes legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted The Duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks the shrunken Boss Hog was too cretinous to be evil and Rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment Its amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first seriesbr br Back to the movie If you watch this film in its own right not as a direct comparison to however you remember the TV series then its not bad at all The real star is of course the General Lee The car chases and stunts are excellent and thats really what DOH is all about Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with Seann William Scott as Cousin Bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious DumbAndDumber sort of way the TV series never achieved The lovely Jessica Simpson is a natch as Miss Daisy Burt Reynolds makes a much improved Boss Hog and MC Gainey makes a believably nasty Rosco P Coltrane the way he always should have beenbr br If you dont like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldnt be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect Otherwise if you want an entertaining caraction movie with a few good laughs thats not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind

0	I should have known I was in trouble with Casper Van Diem as the lead character Words cannot describe nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was But please allow me to try to describe it Horrible acting terrible dialog corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being forcefed the beliefs and propeganda from the Trinity Broadcasting Network Its a weak attempt at trying to show Hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep religious message attached to it They failed miserably It was clearly the worst movie I have seen in a long time
0	This movie is so bad its funny It stars Scott Backula as some coach but thats not important what is important is the large black fellow who plays 1st base First off he has to be at least 75 years old yet still plays minor league baseball second he starts out the movie in the outfield despite not being able to walk let alone run Coach Backula brilliantly moves him to first citing the fact that when he attempts to run he stays in the same place for too long a period of time Backula shows more brilliant coaching strategy in the end of the film SPOILER he tells his star player downtown to hit a home run clearly downtown viewed this as a good move He hit the home run and won the game for his team a minor league squad playing the Twins who were the class of the majors in the movie Now if only Tony Muser manager of the Royals would be as smart a coach as Backula and tell his players to simply hit a home run in every at bat the Royals would never end an inning let alone lose a game
0	1999 will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray First they sent us to EYES WIDE SHUT Then they hyped up THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA which is by far the worst movie of the year What is it about Who the heck knows Its full of selfindulgence and loaded with bad acting I always like to stay and watch the credits but when this thing was over I couldnt get out of the movie theatre fast enough Most of the audience that attended the showing that I was at felt pretty much the same way Dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers Its an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful

1	This is a superb movie suitable for all but the very youngest though accessibility for younger people was marred at least in the print which I saw by the use of some unfortunate choice of English subtitling For much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which timeperiod it is set there is no modern technology shown not even the ubiquitous Chinese bicycle just a drab almost monochrome everyday life against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the Sezuan Opera and of celebratory fireworks Even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war this could still be any time in the past 150 yearsbr br But then we briefly see a motor car late 30s early 40s style and we realise that we are watching a China on the verge of huge upheavals and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of World War 2 and the Communist revolutionbr br Which makes the central characters desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignantbr br But the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today both within China and in other parts of the world the inequality between boys and girls men and women the trade for various purposes in young children corruption in society injustice the importance of friendshipbr br Maybe Im reading too much into this film but I dont think so I also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the United Kingdom whilst dross is passed off as quality materialbr br But dont get me started on that
0	I was very excited when this series premiered in 2005 The premise was very simple and appealing each episode would be a onehour mini movie directed by a famous noteworthy horror director Then when I finally watched them it was a bit of a letdown Some good episodes emerged from that first season but all in all it was a mixed bag I attributed it to the learning curve and figured that season 2 would be a whole lot betterbr br Boy was I in for a shock At least season one had a few good stories here and there Season 2 with the exception of The Black Cat starring the excellent Jeffrey Combs was a complete and total loss to me The episode Sounds Like may very well be the worst thing I have watched on TV in the last 10 years and most of the other episodes arent much better I really hope that season 3 turns this around next year but Im not holding my breath
0	I watched this video at a friends house Im glad I did not waste money buying this one The video cover has a scene from the 1975 movie Capricorn One The movie starts out with several clips of rocket blowups most not related to manned flight Sibrels smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast He edits in his own voiceover instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say The video curiously ends with a showing of the Zapruder film His claims about radiation shielding star photography and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against NASA the astronauts or American in general His science is bad and so is this video
1	This is a docudrama story on the Lindy Chamberlain case and a look at its impact on Australian society It especially looks at the problem of innuendo gossip and expectation when dealing with reallife dramasbr br One issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations Not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis Just because the characters in the movies and on TV act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so This is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings Its an issue that has to be constantly addressedbr br The leads play the characters with depth personality and sensitivity And they are ably supported by a large cast all playing basedonfact individuals Some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in Australia as comic actors It reenforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individualsbr br Spoiler warningbr br I have to say something very personal here in that I am actually an exAdventist who was a practicing member in Australia at the time this incident occurred so I have a slightly different impression of the story than most I think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality and emotional heart I think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers It captured the themes of the story brilliantlybr br I once heard Fred Schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to play the best case for their character they could While this is especially apt for this story I think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well
0	This show is a perfect example of how the CBC should stick to either news sports or satirical sketch comedy As a developer of situation comedy CBC has shown it can combine the pizazz of King of Kensington with the belly laughs of The Beachcombers It is an embarrassment to great shows like Kids in the Hall and Second City that they have to share their comedic roots with this lame productionbr br I have to admit that I didnt give this show much of a chance right from when I first heard of its concept To start half of the concept is a direct attempt to ripoff one of the few sitcom successes in EnglishCanadian history Corner Gas The rest of the conceptthe cultural clashis far from being original and is too often used as a crutch for screen writing laziness The selection of the Muslim religion as the basis for the fish out of water characters seems to be a desperate attempt to be edgy and topical but comes off as forced Some of the jokes that are based around the locals reaction to the newcomers are cringe inducing and thoroughly insulting to the intelligence of everyone involved especially the audiencebr br This show is a perfect example of how CBC just doesnt get it when it comes to creating Canadian content especially when presenting Canada as a multicultural environment Cultural diversity in Canada does not have to be presented in such a heavyhanded and forced way It would be a refreshing change to see CBC introduce diversity into a television show without making the show all about said diversity I doubt that CBC has sufficient sitcom talent to pull off something so subtle A comparison could be made to the way diversity is depicted in Corner Gasie the aboriginal characters are not set apart by their ethnicity nor is their heritage used to generate story lines More realistically their lives and the other characters lives intertwine in a way that makes ethnicity no more significant than any of their other personal characteristicsbr br That being said even as a formulaic fishoutofwater comedy this show fails The acting is weak the comic pacing all over the map and the story premises that I saw were too far beyond the suspension of belief even for a comedy The only saving grace is the talented Derek McGrath who is horribly wasted here I doubt that even the addition of guest stars Colin Mochrie for example as an Anglican archbishop can save this dog I decided to give the show a chance once the CBCs hype had died down but two episodes were all I could standI could almost feel my braincells shutting themselves down with each failed punchline The timeslot would be better served by airing more Coronation Street Air Farce reruns or Dr Who Even an infomercial would be an improvement
1	Emma is a horribly flawed film based on Jane Austens classic novel I have not read the book so I really didnt know that much about the plot and yet I still predicted nearly the entire plot There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing The film is though for some reason very entertaining and I loved it Of course there were all the scenes I disliked but the majority was well acted and funny Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in Emma The film also stars Toni ColletteWho has okay but has been much better Ewan MecgregerWho has also been better but he is still very good here Alan CummingWho I have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here and Jeremy NorthamWhos performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle even if that was not what it needed There have been much better adaptations of Jane Austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching
1	This movie is amazing While being funny and entertaining it is also profoundly deep and eyeopening I will watch it again and again Bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life He has a job and a life but it isnt what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness Bruce is bitter unsatisfied and resentful that his life isnt the way he envisions it should be As a result of this state of mind Bruce ends up losing his job and blaming God for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life God comes to Bruce and grants him Godly powers Bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted His life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happywith one exception In the process of gaining everything he loses the one person who truly loved him As the movie unfolds Bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances but his perception of what was truly there This movie was inspirational and deep If you really pay attention it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize As my wife says Since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy and my humble addition May we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out
0	Magnolia is a preposterous bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little Like Eyes Wide Shut Magnolia is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence The camera swoops through hallways and corridors catching glimpses of sad characters Where is the reason to care for these people The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot who cant care for others except for John C Reillys and Philip Seymour Hoffmans characters and are selfdestructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying I was reminded of how much I disliked Shine because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by Armin MuellerStahl There are so many unattractive unappealing characters here why would we want to spend time with thembr br Having said that there is nothing held back about Magnolia Paul Thomas Andersons ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon There are two ideas in particular that bomb Both happen in the last hour of this 188minute film One has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of Aimee Manns coffeehouse folk songs Sweet but ineffectual since we cant see what strings them all together The other idea I refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculousbr br Magnolia has a lot of great acting Particularly Tom Cruise who unleashes a performance I didnt know he had in him And John C Reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory But it all adds up to nothing When the secret unexpected event happened a girl behind me in the theatre couldnt hold it in any more and said This is stupid My feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree
0	Such a long awaited movie But it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day From the trailers it looked like a action movie but it turned out to be a out out comedya bad comedy But one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors theyve done their part of the movie very well Good acting but i dont think that can save the movie India has been shot beautifully Kerala Rajasthan Ladakh were all saturated with color alright Nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when I could go there br br Action sequences were shot very shabbily no one could make out head tail of the stunts theyve used Akkiakshay kumar very well but couldve been done much much betterbr br Animation is the worst ive seen in recent movies90s movies had better animation scenes i guessinitial scene where the car is falling off flying should be better word the road into lakebr br And the movies name has been mentioned nearly every 20 to 30 mins just to make sure audiences dont forget the movie name i guess
0	Well here we have yet another role reversal movie There were many worth watching despite the tired plot of gender reversal However this one is not In previous reviews I think Ive made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for Haim movies that followed the late 80s This is one of thembr br Just One of the Girls is about a high school kid Corey Haim who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school He joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader Marie Nicole Eggert Obviously he cant keep up the charade for too much longerbr br I thought this movie was utter crap and it wasnt even funny But judging by a majority of reviews it looks like fans of Alanis Morrisette or teen sex queen Nicole Eggert are the only ones whod want to watch this If youre looking for a good Haim feature or role switching comedy look no further than 1989 This is about the point that Haims career tanked

0	I have seen a lot of bad movies with big actors in it But this movie was terrible I have yet to see why people thought it was funny The idea behind it is stupid Plus all the things that are supposed to be funny are just dumb Why anyone would want to watch this more than once just baffles me
1	Sure this movie wasnt like 16 blocks inside man an American haunting etcbr br But It was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us i found this movie really great and scarybr br I live exactly where they filmed this movie san pedro California And we have heard true stories based on incidents of this moviebr br I dunno if youve heard of the famous boat in long beach Queen Mary Well that boat is haunted i believe in spirts illusions and parallel or however u spell that is real everybodys in there own universebr br and the mind is a powerful thingbr br i recommend to watch this movie its great and not bad directing at allbr br for those who rate it a 1 they dont understand the film its meaning its plot its view and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of usbr br Tybr br Victor
1	the only word that sums up this movie is quirky its a lighthearted romp through an existential concept bouncy in more way than one and a bit nutty i wouldnt exactly call it grand and unforgettable cinema and it doesnt seem quite as memorable as the directors first movie cube but its a good pit of fluff to watch on a Sunday morning the acting veers from respectable to annoying at times but i believe thats how it was to be written done as a serious movie it could perhaps have been great or may very well have stepped into a state of pretension a little like the matrix meets head meets human naturebr br 68 out of ten
0	What made the idea of seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would live up to Charlotte Brontes brilliance of the original classic story I was deeply disappointed to find that this movie which seemed to be either written or filmed in great haste had not the qualities that made the original novel so powerful Much of the witty back and forth between the main characters Jane Eyre and Mr Rochester seemed to be either missing from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor Also missing was Jane Eyres charismatic sense of self which enabled her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all The original Jane Eyre was a hero The woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph over including one of the greatest parts of the story when Jane runs away from Thornfield and Mr Rochester Her struggle to find food and shelter her shame at having to beg for bread the threat of freezing to death in the cold all to get away from a man she loved were in my opinion poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie The title character seemed dry and uninspired The story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book I cannot imagine that this story would be the least bit interesting The screenplay and Direction did little if any credit to the classic story
0	The film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour It starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good funny story is to come Well I can tell you it will not come It will deteriorate in minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an extend you will probably not be pleased to witness br br In an interview I heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that according to him the majority of the people in this globalizing world experience I was amazed to hear that Am I living in the same world he lives in OK a lot of people do walk around in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and all but that doesnt make me feel like I am losing my identity What does Khrzhanosvky think that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch Am I shortsighted or is hebr br Well my vote the good start of the movie saves it from getting a 1 a decent 4 is my conclusion
0	Its spelled SLASHERS I was happy when the main character flashed her boobs That was pretty tight Before and after that the movie pretty much blows The acting is like Elist and its shown well in the movie Not to mention it is so low budget that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are played by the same person The whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film The only other reason I liked the movie was because Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny They said many stupid things that made me laugh Other than that if you see this movie at Blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind Lawnmowerman 2 Anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated
0	Last weekend I bought this zombie movie from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of Land of the Deadbr br Boy was I wrong br br It seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the coverart which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genrebr br We watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cellphone They actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him but once they started driving the car I couldnt suspend my disbelief anymorebr br Some people actually consider this a so bad its good movie they are liars I didnt finish the movie but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way throughbr br This is even worse than Zombiez DO NOT WATCH
0	This movie had to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen The acting was terrible Horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot I will never watch this movie again nor will I recommend this movie to anyone What a waste of time First as soon as the movie began I realized what I got myself into All they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie The prank phone calls halloween night a psycho and one knife Its absolutely ridiculous I was not scared at all during the movie which I thought horror movies were supposed to do As for the making of the movie its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary I mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of Scary Movie for example At least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie

0	Terrible movie If there is one Turkish film you should avoid seeing in 2006 that should be Banyo What a waste of time Other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing nada zilch nil The dialog is cheap and sexual clichés are all over it The director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own The red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do If you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting The only good thing I can say about the movie is wait wait there is nothing good I can say about it I must have really disliked it to write about it this much Jeez
0	This very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget Dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid chase scenes are uniformly boring and most of the onscreen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the films last five minutes a briefly glimpsed portapotty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the films chief villainno prop is here without a purpose The whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of Rodger Cormans studio when hed give a first time director a few bucks and a camerabut without the discipline Corman would impose
0	I had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school As figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new Though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through It had an interesting side to it but it just doesnt live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original We have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust then we have the father who is always gone Then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does On to the story like I said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling Everything about this fell into cliché the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl they get together have sex and then boom we have a little kid Perhaps it couldve been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved Ive seriously gotten more emotion out of Leatherface and his chainsaw than I did out of any actor in this film and thats pretty bad seeing as the Leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted So far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie Ive seen was Juno So far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message Like I said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity I really hope someone decides to either remake this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential
0	I really didnt expect much from this film seeing as it has people from Parkersburg WV which is were I live acting in it This town is dull and so is this film There were a few decent scened in the movie but I was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show This movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasnt any Unless you are from Parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday then stay away from this movie The dialog will put you to sleep the acting will bore you to tears and Steven Soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this Its a predictable movie with no surprises What you see is what you get and that is a 73 minute tour of Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a narrator
1	i wasnt a fan of seeing this movie at all but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs anticsbr br overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like heaven a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess the movie was quite short though around 85 min but it was enough to tell the whole story build some character development and have a decent happy ending the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast especially jason biggs kept the laughs coming at a smooth pacebr br overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating hey its a chick flick and im reviewing this movie from a guys persepctive alright it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it

0	About three minutes into this thing I started fastforwarding pausing only during the nudity why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women In ten minutes I was done and wishing I could get my money back from the rental store The people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the MPAA Come on writers the bad guys ALWAYS get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guys remote control Thats the way its been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire Also to add insult to injury the twist at the end was so formulaic that it could have come from any action movie written in the past 25 years Burt Reynolds was fine but he should concentrate on real moviesbr br This movie is just a waste of time Run away Run away

0	This is a wellworn story about a man who marries to escape the hangmans noose then sets about taming his reluctant bride It manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time We never find out for example why a woman who won the respect of an Indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband Or why the members of her team are so eager to get a real man in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own This only made sense in fifties Hollywoodbr br Theres a really stupid scene where she horsewhips him and he actually catches the whipthe second timethen yanks her off her horse Never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip Then he prevails in a fight against her Indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp Thats some second wind Later he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty Indians as they all are in these flicks after they reject her now shes his squaw Never mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and shes been negotiating with them for years And the way he keeps rejecting her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on himyeah right Like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trailbr br Finally neither of the leads is convincing in their roles Madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky Fleming flips her hair and scowls a lot but is totally unconvincing as a fiery tomboy The only reason youd root for her is because you want to see Madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the films end The way that Madison tames Fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blowup dolls Even if you do see them as dolls the total lack of suspense will bore youbr br Total waste of time Even the scenerys kinda dull Give this one a big miss
1	Warning Mild Spoilers Aheadbr br Yes I realize its tough to spoil an historical documentary but I do reveal some of the backstory and methodsbr br This is an exceptional documentary not just because of the remarkable footage but also due to the story behind it Because the Naudets did not set out to tell the story of 911 but rather that of a rookie firefighter the mens emotions and the viewers connection with them are more real and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective br br In a filmmaking sense 911 is textbook If the events were an actual script they would be superb as the characters are established then thrown a curve to which they must react This is all the more amazing considering the pain and emotion of the raw footage that the directors had to wade through to piece this story together br br The first portion of the film provides a glimpse of life inside a fire station specifically how a rookie assimilates himself into a crew of veterans That part alone is quite good and had the documentary been allowed to run its intended course it probably would have been solid The brothers appear to realistically portray the process of becoming a NYC firefighter br br Then of course all hell breaks loose The chaos following the WTC attacks is vividly seen as various characters that we have gotten to know are thrust into terrifying situations Seeing not only the attacks but also the firsthand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human emotion br br The aftermath in which firefighters are discovered to be lost and found is human drama at its peak Life and death hang in the balance Unlike many movies the viewer not only doesnt know who will live and die but genuinely cares about them br br The only negative thing I have to say about this is that the Robert DeNiro whom I like blurbs were uninformative unnecessary and didnt advance the story at all They were probably added just to attract more television viewersbr br Bottom Line The best documentary Ive ever seen Nonpareil portrayals of raw human emotion and drama 95 out of 10

1	The previous reviewer has said it exactly I saw it once was enchanted saw it a second time when it was rebroadcast within a week or two of the first airing I still remember some of the scenes The setting is the opening of the 20th century the war referred to in the title is World War I One of the scenes was set in a womenonly section of a public place which was an interesting historical note The moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my alltime great movie moments I dont think of this as a gay movie its an interesting and tender period love story where the two principals happen to be women I would love to see this movie again I would buy this one if it ever came out on DVD
1	People expect no less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg directs a movie and this movie is no exception Some movies I love did poorly at the box office but Im glad to say this movie isnt one of them over nine million dollars which I dont think was bad for back then The characters were fun the animation was clear and not fuzzy and the music was modern too which is unusual for an animated movie I didnt think Professor Screw Eyes or his Scary Cirus was too scary for little kids the targeted audience for this movie but I thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids movie Overall this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that I have loved dearly for years
0	Some people say Steve Irwins larrikin antics and gregarious personality are only an act Watch this film its obvious he cant actbr br Steve Irwin dangerman star of the small screen in his Crocodile Hunter Diaries Croc Files and eponymous Crocodile Hunter series you see a naming trend here or is it just me rockets his largerthanstrife persona to the big screen with Crocodile Hunter Collision Course yup  theres a definite trend of words beginning with C basically an episode of Crocodile Hunter mashed together with a BMoviebr br On a mission to relocate a big croc to save it from being shot by an eccentric farmer Magda Szubanski Steve and wife Terri are unaware that the croc is being tracked by American spies Lachy Hulme and Kenneth Ransom out to recover a spy satellite beacon it has swallowed Will it hurt my credibility to say Theyre on a Collision Course with Wackiness what credibility Ed notebr br The plot is irrelevant as it is Steves animal magnetism that propels the film If you find his persona trying the film is a failure but if youre a fan of either him as a businessman conservationist or just plain assklown or his television shows expect more of the same on a widescreen budgetbr br John Stainton faithful liege best mate and helmer of the Crocodile Hunter oeuvre can it be called that with a straight face writes and directs with the same provincial swagger that made Steve a household wildlife jesterbr br The most jarring aspect of this movie is that Steve one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the exclamation points going by as he speaks and Terri Steves spouse of 10 years fiercest ally and closest friend treat it like it IS one of their documentaries breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly to the camera whilst all the other characters behave as if theyre in a bad movie well It wouldnt be so incongruous if Steve and Terri were kept separated from the rest of the characters  but when the Bad Americans constantly threaten Steves life we Confused Viewers must ask ourselves why the indifferent camera crew doesnt at least call the cops if not try to poke the bad guys in the eye with the boom mics or run screaming into the bush  anything but continue filming casually with great lighting crisp audio and seven action angles br br While Terri is unfairly painted as Steves mildly incompetent sidekick her acting consists of boldly inept line reads and gadding about in pearshapedbuttockhugging jeans for the last Im not complaining Steve goes about his businessasusual of showandtell with creatures intent on killing him doing all his stunts himself because well to him theyre not really stunts just a Day At The Office br br Of course watching this madmans kookoo adventures after his tragic death in September 2006 casts a strange detachment over the proceedings But to those of us who never met him this kind of malarkey as well as various incarnations of the Crocodile Hunter series in constant reruns keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows The wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him And I truly wish them the best in following in his outsize footprints br br So enjoy this diversion for what it is  a halfbaked movie featuring a fullon legend He died doing what he loved  interacting with wildlife and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film in portraying him doing just thatbr br Movie Maniacs visit poffysmoviemaniacom
1	Clever gritty witty fastpaced sexy extravagant sleazy erotic heartfelt and corny Footlight Parade is a firstclass entertainment what the movies are all aboutbr br The realistic satirical treatment gives a fresh edge to the material and its pace and line delivery are breathtaking To think that they only started making feature talking pictures 7 years before this The brilliance of the dialogue cannot be matched anywhere today especially considering that realism has taken over and engulfed contemporary cinemabr br This film was made at a time when the Hayes code restricting content was being ignored and the result is a fresh selfreferential critical and living cinema that spoke directly to contemporary audiences suffering through the depression and the general angst of the age Id recommend watching any film from this period that is 19301935 for a vision of what popular cinema can potentially be

0	The book is so good that at least the opening of this madefortv movie will move you but then as it diverges more and more from the book taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches it becomes boring Still from comments Ive heard people who have not read the book tend to like it and if it leads even on child to read A Wrinkle in Time it will have served its purpose The most embarrassing change is to make the Happy Medium a clone of Mary Poppins Uncle Albert I love to Laugh Nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny
1	When it comes to movies I can be pretty picky and Ill complain about anything and everything that is done wrong While every movie has its flaws The Night Listener had an exceptionally low countbr br If you read the last review it was hard since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done Unfortunately if you read more than 3 lines into that same review you discovered the posters reason for disdain heshe does not like the fact that the director is gay or that the production team smokes crackapparentlybr br So despite the fact that I have never written a review before I thought this movie deserved one based on its merits not the sexual orientation of its director Lets go over a quick checklist first 1 Great plot Absolutely I wont give a shred of it away but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials This is a thriller not a horror and it should be approached as such The story really will amaze you even more so because its true and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual eventsbr br 2 Wonderful Acting Oh Yes Robin Williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy typecast and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago He once again achieves high form in his role in The Night Listener playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case ofwell Ill let you see for yourselfbr br 3 Excellent direction Certainly Now unlike the other poster to which I referred I actually know something about direction Ive been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years Of course I really dont think that makes a lick of difference the only thing that matters is if YOU like the direction but I thought I should simply establish once again that Im basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevantfor example not the sexual orientation of the director or the alleged drug habits of the production team LOLbr br Patrick Stettners direction was moody and dark and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those sosoughtafter feelings of tension and release rather than the messy fastpaced camerawork and quick cuts were so often subjected to today Some people can truly show you a story through their camera while others feel as if they have to make the story with the camera I really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized which is as an eyeball through which we all seebr br 4 Lighting cinematography and editing Great all around Ive already wrote so much and I could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs so Ill just wrap it upbr br In short go see this movie Dont listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it especially if theyre so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 14 of the way through their post Enjoy the show Ben
1	911 is a classic example of cinema verite a sort of realist documentary in this case of New York firemen as they battle against one of the most extraordinary events of world history Its all tiny unobtrusive handheld video cameras often betrayed by the poor quality of most of the filming and by the director Naudets hand frequently wiping the screenbr br In this film you get to know most of the firemen Tony Benatatos the rookie or probie in NY fireman vernacular the Fire Chief Joseph Pfeiffer who finds hes lost his brother later on and a few others There are studio interviews with most of these people throughout the film just to emphasise the personal reflexive nature of the events The buildup is quite dramatic and welldone particularly the passingout ceremony at the Fire Department with a few useful swishpans and a sort of dialectical editing of the rather limited filmwork just like Rob Reiners A Few Good Men Tony looks proudbr br The viewpoint and camera angle is usually from amidst the firemen which is interesting and there is some excellent footage from inside the lobby of WTC1 while Pfeiffer and his team plan what to do next this is classic cinema verite There is also the eery haunting sound of the occasional human body crashing against the portico outside It is then that an increasingly forlorn Fire Chief Pfeiffer realises that his task is desperate and probably hopeless and this is before WTC2 collapses You have to give credit to Naudet for knowing which faces to film and at which momentbr br The sound of the neighbouring WTC2 collapsing is so awfully sad poignant and terrifying that you realise what an ordeal this is for the firemen From the lobby it looks feels and sounds like the end of the world and the poor firemen look so utterly bewildered and frightened You hear an enormous rumbling trembling maelstrom like that of a giant monolithic beast slowly falling to the ground after being so mortally wounded the neighbouring tower has collapsed yet the fire team remaining in WTC1 are oblivious to this event Where is the communicationbr br This film is captivating yet the narration is amateurish and should have been avoided cues like this really was a day like no other or Naudets frequently banal pronouncements like you could see fear in everybodys eyes and I knew Tony was freaking out The film is really just one long video diary There are no pictures from higher up the building where some of the firemen have gone Imagine this film blended with CCTV footage from some of the rooms higher up or some of the news coverage from the day The effect would be greater You could even combine this story with that of Mayor Giuliani and perhaps the famous Cornishman Rick Riscorla who literally was many floors up acting the herobr br I dont see much of a propaganda element in this film as some reviewers suggest This film is no Triumph of the Will by Riefenstahl Some time later the firemen drape the American flag over a nearby surviving building overlooking what has become Ground Zero So whatbr br There are also some moments of dubious camerawork for example who is holding the camera when the two Naudet brothers are reunited back at the fire station Is it stagedbr br There is an excellent finish very much in the traditon of the excellent French director Alain Resnais Hiroshima mon amour with two strips of light reflected in the water shimmying
1	This movie was excellent A sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes This is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie You have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way Doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions This equals on big happy movie in the end This movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets You see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture The cinemaphotography is excellent in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers Bound to be in Oscar contention for best foreign film
1	Space Camp is a pretty decent film The plot is predictable but the actors do a good job and the special effects are decent for the timebr br This film was originally released about the time of the shuttle disaster and that really put a hamper on how popular it wasbr br The scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular on the big screen that is on a TV it just looks average I remember this scene in the theater It made you feel like you were really up therebr br This would be a good film to see on IMAX but Im sure that will never happen
1	This was the most visually stunning moving amazing and incredible story Ive ever experienced Quite frankly even those adjectives just cannot describe it I cant just choose one scene that stood out for me I suppose if I had to list a few it would be the reactions of the fireman to the crashing sound of jumping victims the reaction of people trapped in the elevator who were unaware of what was going on as they finally emerge to the horrific scene the shock and disbelief of the onlookers and finally the silence br br On that day and even now I am reminded of Star Wars 1977 ObiWan says I felt a great disturbance in the Force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced It is amazing how it is so accurate in its description There was truly a disturbance in the Forcebr br This documentary vividly reveals this disturbance The feelings are so incredibly visual The anger the frustration the shock the fear the exhaustion and the realization of its very magnitude Its all there Not a thing is missedbr br This is a powerful and most moving documentary and well deserving of the Emmy Not just because it documents 911 but because it is simply everything it should be br br If you plan to watch be sure to grab a box of tissues Youll need them I know that I did

0	Way back in 1967 a certain director had no idea about a galaxy far away or near He was trying to complete a movie with the title THX etc this short is a remanufactured history of a certain George i am sorry it has only cuteness to defend it This is merely an advertising promo for the director actors et al It has little intrinsic artistic value It is a brochure The lead playing George is very fine as is the Leia character and the ersatz Darth character All else is plain commercial dross What a waste Still it got the job done I guess The rest of the movie is merely treading water to kill time I guess a brochure only

0	Interesting to read comments by viewers regarding Omega Code many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from TBN broadcasts the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video to be stocked besides the threepart rapture series that was done by some other religious group in the 70s dont remember it You wont remember this one either in a year or two This is the first movie I have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls very shameful this just goes to show that if you are a televangelists son you too can play highroller Hollywood producer with lil ole ladies tithe money

1	Sisters In Law is made by the same directors of the rather curiously fascinating Divorce Iranian Style which was as exactly as it stated as we got a glimpse of Divorce court in Iran Now theyve turned their attention to the court system in Cameroon Africa Whats great about this court is that 2 of the magistrates are Women which is unusual for such a country like this Anyways they deal with plenty of men used to getting their way around the women but this film is remarkable in the fact that it appears that women has made great strides in society with divorce legal and womens rights being recognized So the judges often chastise the men for behaving in a primitive way in these times Not to say that the women who appear at the court get the softer treatment One of the prime focuses of the film is a case of child abuse done by an Aunt The judges waste no time in lashing out at the woman with fury And who said that justice isnt served anymore With these 2 behind the bench They often carry out maximum penalties Ya You go girl

0	Perhaps being a former Moscovite myself and having an elastic sense of humor prevents me from tossing this movie into the arthousefestival crap trashcan Its not the greatest film of 2005 nor is it complete garbage It just has a lot of problems I also sincerely doubt this movie was banned due to any ideological fears or conservative taboos or any other reason this movie might conversely be called courageous and uncompromising abroad It was banned because the censors knew 99 of the Russian filmgoers would find it offensive because of the bad taste exercised during the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull filmbr br So we have a strong opening shot Wonderful sound design excellent premise laden with meaning and symbolism The usage and placement of symbols will consistently be of the films strongest aspects not that the number 4 is a daunting visual challenge Over the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong setup An amusing and wellwritten bar conversation among the 3 main characters and we feel pathos for these people the great country of Russia the human condition and all that Then the movie starts slowing down We begin to wonder what yawn lies aheadbr br The rest is quite boring simply put Sure the guy in the village tugs the heartstrings and there are some slightly amusing moments Nice sound sure But the enjoyment of this movie not to mention the plot are seriously compromised by the pacing problems And this this lack of a payoff for sitting through all the nicelyshot abject misery and bleakness is what ultimately will make people angry at the offensive stuff personally the main offensive scene bordered on being endearing in that pathetic way harmless drunks can appearbr br If you want to watch an enjoyable movie where Russians get wasted for prolonged periods of time the entire film watch Particulars of the National Hunt Much more rewarding postSoviet stuff So yeah a 4 out of 10 for 4 nice and symbolic of my postmediocrefilm condition

1	I totally agree that Nothing is a fantastic film Ive not laughed so much when watching a film for ages and David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are fantastic in this they really work well together This film may not appeal to some people I cant really say why without spoiling it but each to their own I loved it and highly recommend itbr br The directing is great and some of the shots are very clever It looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming itbr br Although there are really only main 2 characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch

0	This film was so disappointing From the blurb that made me decide to see Phantom Love why is it called thisI had expected something arty and thoughtful with beautiful imagery It did have some interesting images but these often seemed random and made no sense In fact they seemed like they were inserted to fill in time In the end the effect was listlessbr br I believe the film was meant to be atmospheric but it just wasnt The lack of a coherent plot did not help matters You might say it was mysterious but I think it was just incoherent with no atmospherebr br The main character seemed to be disturbed but the plot did not draw me in enough to care about her situation Without looking at the cast list I would not have known that you see the main character as a child The film has very little context for the time place or character I am not a prude but the sex scenes there were several seemed pointless and confused me further I recognised Lulu but I was not sure if it was the same man different men a lover her husband or was she a prostitute It was only when I saw the credits that I discovered the hairy back was meant to belong to her lover This film did manage to make what should have been shocking dream sequences involving Lulus mother seem a bit boringbr br The nail filing actually made more sense as it did give some indication of Lulus emotional state I will not fault the actors as I dont they had a lot to work onbr br I do not know if the lack of context or flow in the film was because of ineptitude or because it was pretentious but the end result was dullbr br I cant be bothered talking about it anymore

0	Saw this film ran in the wee hours on TCM Several problems with the film were apparent from what I saw First the adults did not age when the children did for 10 years Several parts of the film had continuity problems for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the 10 years passed br br The copy I saw was missing about 20 minutes or so at least a huge gap with black screen appeared It is too bad because even though the script left something to be desired Bergman Russell both did fine in the film in their roles It is a shame the large chunk is missing but what is here is watchablebr br I just wish it was all intact The script makes little sense in that Bergmans character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults Some of the time lines dont make sense either There is a stock market crash that resembles 1929 but the kids grow up to fight in World War 1 All the acting by the support folks in this film is fine Just wonder what was in the 20 gap of film I could not see as it was missing

0	This movie looked good good cast evergreen topic and an explosive opening It went downhill from there Why was it filmed by hand held camera It shakes judders part captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer A poor choice indeed As if this was not enough the worst edit in memory assumes a drugged viewer mandatory if you want to get any enjoyment from it at all And then it commits the worst sin of all After leading the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion they roll credits without revealing the denouement the ending the payoff like what the heck was the motive How can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending Doh This movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud What a waste of effort Poor effort by writer and director

1	By no means my favourite Austen novel and Paltrow is by no means my favourite actress but I found the film almost totally delightful Paltrow does a good job and Cummings Stevenson and the one who plays Miss Bates are all absolutely terrific The period detail is not alienating the feel of the movie is just right in fact But the real find is Jeremy Northam as Mr Knightley There could not be more perfect casting IMO I hated Mr K in the novel but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film Northams good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment either Highly recommended AnaR
1	This light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value It gets quite hysterically funny at times but if you havent spent any time on that side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it eruptsbr br The cast of characters meld well together and are quite believable in their roles How Grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played Shes a true lady And my favorite is Graces white pimp suit that she wearsbr br I highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud who cheers for the underdog or just wishes to watch something different
1	I originally caught this back in 1996 in its one week run at a movie theatre I was under impressed by it and my feelings havent much changedbr br Documentary about the infamous Edward D Wood Jr covering his life and movies There are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him They include Vampira Dolores Fuller Bela Lugosi Jr Loretta King Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco Interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations It is interesting somewhat but was this really needed Ive seen all of Woods films and theyre just terrible Wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out I wouldnt say he was the worst director ever but hes down there Do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker I do like the fact that they didnt try to make Wood out to be some sort of saint More than a few of those interviewed especially Lugosi Jr pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear Also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s Still its of interest if youre a Wood fan The best interviews are with Vampira who tears Wood apart and Dolores Fuller a long time girlfriend
1	Ive been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too Some of the users are stuck in a realist type of mentality This film was meant to be a fantasya what if fun film It was never meant to be real or serious It was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone I knew when it came out even though it shadowed the tragedy of the Challenger explosionI was 30 at the time and totally enjoyed this one my young son loved it too Later I shared it with my daughter and she too loved it SpaceCamp is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that fun All the realists in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film So sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real SpaceCamp one in Alabama and one at Vandenberg AFB in California they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt letdownI guess their parents didnt explain the difference between fantasy and reality Oh well If you love fantasyfun films and havent seen this one I highly recommend it Enjoy
0	This is the biggest pile of crap I have ever watched DO NOT RENT The makers of this movie should be band from ever making another movie It starts with some what of a plot then fades fast to nothing I think I would rather watch paint dry then to as much as looking at the cover The actors were awful the plot faded fast filming left to much work to be done Not one good thing to say about this crap movie If you rent this movie you will waste your money I really enjoy National Lampoon movies but this was a waste of time Learn to write learn to act learn to produce and learn to direct I feel I should sue these aholes that made this movie for money wasted on rental cost and time lost
0	I have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie I guess I must have missed something The beginning is intriguing the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories Thats the best part After the three go their separate ways the film splits into three threads Thats when boredom sets in Certainly the thread with the Felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity Unfortunately the director beat this one to death even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular Bottom line a twohour plotthin listlessness If you suffer from insomnia view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep
0	Im basing this on my observations of one episode I saw last night 92706 I dont think Ill be watching again The acting was totally wooden the plot completely predictable the ending totally unrealistic I mean who would believe a 30 million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer The lead actor Victor Garber seemed so uncomfortable almost embarrassed in his role perhaps he realized how bad the writing was I fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor but they can surely find better writers Maybe they are outsourcing the writing to India or China Ill bet we wont be seeing this one next season
0	If you like bad movies this is the one to see Its incredibly lowbudget special effects youll see what I mean and use of nonactors was what gave this film its charm If youre bored with a group of friends I highly recommend renting this B movie gem Its mulletrific
1	Like one of the previous commenters said this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery Such a waste because Collettes performance was eerie and Williams was believable I just kept waiting for it to get better I dont think it was bad editing or needed another director it could have just been the film It came across as a Canadian movie something like the first few seasons of XFiles Not cheap just hokey Also it needed a little more suspense Something that makes you jump off your seat The movie reached that moment then faded away kind of like a false climax I can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the reality of the story but I thought that part was reached when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy This movie needs to have a Directors cut that tries to fix these problems
0	Strange how less than 2 hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat uninspiring drivel If a story is as personal as this supposedly was to Sally Potter wouldnt you expect a little passion to show through in her performance Her acting was completely detached and I felt no chemistry between Sally and Pablo and the tango scenes which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance were instead awkward and painful to watch Obviously revealing such a personal story on film can be daunting and as such Sally Potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own sheepishness
1	Why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like The Godfather Titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st CenturyWith great actingdirectingeffectsmusic and generally everything This movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didnt like it any more so most of the world decided to agree There is nothing wrong with this movie All I can say is that this movie not only being the most heavily Oscar Awarded movie of all time the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies Ive ever seen Apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time The only movies that come close to being like all the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings trilogy or anything by the masters Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton These are all good movies and directors but none match up to James Camerons Masterpiece TITANIC
1	Meryl Streep was incredible in this film She has an amazing knack for accents and she shows incredible skill in this film overall I really felt for her when Lindy was being persecuted She was played realistically too She got cranky upset and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt I didnt expect much from the film initially but I really got interested in it and the movie is based on a real person and real events It turned out to be better than I had anticipated Sam Neill was also outstanding this is the best work Ive seen from him and Ive really liked him in other movies The Piano for example I gave the film a 7 but if I could rate just the acting Id give the it a 95 and a perfect 10 for Streep
1	This is one of the finest films to come out of Hong Kongs New Wave that began with Tsui Harks ZU Warriors of Magic Mountain Tsui set a tone for the New Waves approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the New Wave Jackie Chan Sammo Hung Wong Jing Ching Siu Tung etc accepted from then on as a given namely the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony if not outright comedy Burning Paradise put a stop to all that and with a vengeancebr br Its not that there isnt humor here but it is a purely human humor as with the aged Buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw But this is just as humans are not even Buddhist priests can be saints all the timebr br When irony is at last introduced into the film it is the nastiest possible emanating from the abbot of Red Lotus Temple who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before He is the very incarnation of Miltons Satan from Paradise Lost Better to rule in Hell than serve in heaven And if he cant get to Satans hell soon enough hell turn the world around him into a living hell he can rulebr br Thats the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here Its not that the Abbot just wants to kill people he wants them to despair to feel utterly hopeless to accept his nihilism as allencompassing reality Thus theres a definite sense pervading the Red Temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the Temple itself it has become all there is to the universe and the Abbot claiming mastery of infinite power is in chargebr br Of course fortunately the film doesnt end there Though there are losses the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails If you want to know how see the film Yet there is no doubt that in viewing this film we visit hell Hopefully we do not witness our own afterlives but we certainly feel chastened by the experience and somehow better for it over all
0	1st watched 11072004 1 out of 10DirJon Keeyes Overthetop rehash of 70s supposed horror flicks like Friday the 13thversions 1 thru whatever I cant think of much redeeming here exceptor can I think of anything The story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program one year after some kids were slayed in the woods as an homage to this supposedly But lo and behold one of the stupid people have connections to the actual event because her sister was one of the ones murderedagain how stupid is this that she would even be a part of this Guess what The murderer is at it again and were tipped off from the very beginning who it isso there goes any mystery whatsoever And besides all this where are the cops and why doesnt someone call them I cant believe this movie was financed by someone and made You would think that by now the American people would be judged a little higher at least in their moviegoing experience but not so by this filmmaker
0	And I mean ultra light This film features four giant stars about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond thatbr br There really isnt too much to say about this stinker other than that although it has a couple of really good bits most of it isnt very funny Nor does it work at all as a romance How about as a romantic comedy Not on your life Most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated much less amusingbr br Whats really ashame is the premise is not bad at all This movie could have been so much more especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted complete with phony quotes from critics The film uncovers the unmined territory of the press junket those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews But instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the films lame romancebr br The same with Catherine ZetaJones character the whinny self centered movie star ZetaJones does a good job with what shes given but shes given practically nothing Its all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things weve heard about stars over the yearsbr br In the end it is hard to understand what made ZetaJones Julia Roberts John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign aboard this doomed ship which sinks like a rerun of The Love Boat In fact as the old joke goes they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal It would probably make a better story So go ahead and tell us filmmakers what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this
1	This movie is not schlock despite the lo fi production and its link to Troma productions A dark fable for adults Exploitation is a theme of Sugar Cookies and one wonders if the cast has not fallen prey to said theme A weird movie with enticing visuals shadows and contrast are prominent Definitely worth a look especially from fans of Warhol and stylish decadence Through all the cruelty and wickedness a moral albeit twisted can be gleamed
0	Rarely have I witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent There is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film What few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings Actors of stature Robert Duvall Robert Downey Jr are deployed in roles which go nowhere a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffeestained camera lens a writer John Grisham who has never produced anything of merit discovers new depths of undermotivated incoherence The film has a cheap lecherous feel about it but barely at the level of commentary its really part of the aesthetic Normally I come on to the IMDb to write balanced generally appreciative comments This egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless bilious rant I wont but only because I no longer want to occupy my mind with this trash
1	Modern original romantic storybr br Very good acting of both Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplinbr br Miss Kidman does a nice job in imitating a Russian accent Ben Chaplin is also good as the shy dull clerk For the men and some women miss Kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic I forgot what a gorgeous woman she is Its not hard to imagine that John falls in love with her Some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense Although I hoped for a happy ending the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me br br Conclusion good movie br br Les PaysBas huit points
0	Stupid mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes piloted by Burgess Meredith chasing a Porsche race car which runs on decadesold gasoline sludge driven by Lee Majors with Chris Makepeace as the runaway technowiz who can McGyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society As moronic as it sounds Terrible waste of Burgess Meredith but Chris Makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film
0	No Fireworks Despite Violent Actionbr br Science fiction films that reflect quality are scarce indeed largely because transposal of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention and unfortunately for its producers this work is lacking on both counts woefully so in the case of the latter With essentially no budget with which to operate it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and in particular special effects of space opera warfare which appear only clownish while seeds from the scriptors imagination lie fallow due to some of the most fatuous misunderstanding of basic scientific principles to be found Among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility The plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station penal colony to a waste landfill upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to Earth with some few capable players present who are execrably directed by firsttimer Paolo Mazzucato whose production team wastes effort upon such as holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic requirement for the creation of states of suspense and of impetusbr br
0	The only thing remarkable about this movie is that all the actors could bomb at the same time Idiocy I want my money backand I got it free from the library Sheesh I would rather chew on tin fool and shave my head with a cheese grater then watch this again
0	Dick Foran and Peggy Moran who were so good together in THE MUMMYS HAND return for this very minor Universal Horror offering But this time instead of having Wallace Ford as the comedic sidekick Babe we get Fuzzy Knight substituting as a silly buddy named Stuff But the results are nowhere near as charming and the scare level is virtually nilbr br Dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle Peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride But there is a tall and skinny John Carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as The Phantom who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himselfbr br This phantom is not very mysterious and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness Its always nice to see perky Moran but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of Universals instantly forgettable misfires
1	I was so impressed with Doug McGraths film version of the Jane Austen novel Emma and I loved the music score by Rachel Portman so much that when I went to the video store one day and discovered the two had reunited for Nicholas Nickleby I immediately rented it without any other considerationbr br I have read the book and for those overlycritical fans of this Jane Austen adaptation I dont know what else McGrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of Miss Austens work especially given the limitations of a two hour movie which some have complained about being too long And as far as Gwen Paltrows accent is concerned I must confess I wasnt too familiar with her when I saw this at the theater initially and I was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an English actressbr br I am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery That is one of the things I enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the English countryside The films beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success If your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker then perhaps you should rent something like Death Wish IIIbr br The English country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings McGrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this storybr br This refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex violence or even a villainous antagonist The story is often amusing endearing and at times quite touchingbr br I have seen many competent Jane Austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite
0	In Texas seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the Halloween night before going to a party Meanwhile they call the American Nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost fears A serial killer who is listening to their confessions makes their nightmares come true killing each one of them in a sadistic way American Nightmare is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning without any previous explanation a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area as if it were Friday 13th Then the story shifts to a bar where seven friends are celebrating Halloween From this moment on the story has a great potential and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies as usual in this type of C production However the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse Jane Toppan giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting With a better beginning and conclusion this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie My vote is fourbr br Title Brazil Agonia Agony
1	This is easily the most underrated film inn the Brooks cannon Sure its flawed It does not give a realistic view of homelessness unlike say how Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers or Titanic gave a realistic view of Italians YOU IDIOTS Many of the jokes fall flat But still this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive Its not The Fisher King but its not crap either My only complaint is that Brooks should have cast someone else in the lead I love Mel as a Director and Writer not so much as a lead
0	End of the World is an uneventful movie which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth The main character is some kind of scientist Im not exactly sure what kind He has two jobs at a government facility guarded by four security men His first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job 2 Job 2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark roomat least thats the best I can figure Apparently the plant is not exactly topsecret as the scientist brings his wife there She hangs out theyre on their way to a dinner while he discovers a message from space Major Earth Disruption repeated over and over He says something about it being the first message from space hes ever been able to decipher his wife tells him theyre going to be late for the dinner party So they leave and go to the party Moments later he finds out that China has suffered a major earthquake From there the movie goes nowhere Yes Christopher Lee is in it but that really doesnt help much Besides Lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in Howling II This movie is boring but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like Christopher Lee or Zgrade scifi Plus theres lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed
1	This is one of the best films I have seen in years I am not a Gwyneth Paltrow fan but she is excellent as Emma Woodhouse Alan Cumming is superb as Reverand Elton and Emma Thompsons sister Sophie is hysterical as Miss Bates And check out the gorgeous Jeremy Northam as Mr Knightley what a gentleman Whoever said you need sex and violence in a movie to make it good has never seen Emma I think that is what separates it from so many othersits classybr br If youre looking for a film that you can watch with the whole family or looking for a romance for yourself look no further Emma is that movie With a beautiful setting wonderful costumes and an outstanding cast have I mentioned the gorgeous Jeremy Northam Emma is a perfect ten
1	And thats how the greatest comedy of TV started It has been 12 years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same spirit till the very last season Because thats where Friends is based on quotes Extraordinary situations are taking place among six friends who will never leave from our hearts Lets say a big thanks to Rachel Ross Monica Joey Chandler and Phoebe In our first meet we see how Rachel dumps a guy in the church how understand Monicas search for the perfect guy there is no perfect guy why all you women are obsessed with that and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that shes a lesbian Till we meet Joey Phoebe and Chandler in the next episodes ENJOY FRIENDS
1	i watched this movie 10 years ago and have watched it on video an average of once a year since its the type of movie thats timeless because the themes are universal yet the stories and conversation are so personal its also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll despite the fact that there are really just two very involving characters this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality TV and now the phenomenon is rampant i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space and makes you think however jaded you may be that you are one of those characters it also made me want to ride the train around Europe i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie maybe that speaks about myself my friends or just the sheer genius of this movie
1	Jane Austen would definitely approve of this onebr br Gwyneth Paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of Emma She is funny without being excessively silly yet elegant She puts on a very convincing British accent not being British myself maybe Im not the best judge but she fooled meshe was also excellent in Sliding DoorsI sometimes forget shes American br br Also brilliant are Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law Emma Thompsons sister and mother as the Bates women They nearly steal the showand Ms Law doesnt even have any linesbr br Highly recommended

1	I was all ready to pan this episode seeing that this Master really doesnt have any horror films under his belt but this is easily the best episode of the seasonbr br The acting was good I dont know how he wrangled it but weve got some real talent in this episode And while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full 56 mins something that has been lacking up to this point in the seriesbr br I especially liked the bit at the end not a twist per say but just a funny little bit where he becomes as ever the henpecked hubbybr br Really good effort Like Ive said in other reviews these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes but they may someday end up being masters in the future
1	Some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them As I watched this film made in 1988 in 1999 I thought I was watching the OJ Simpson debacle although I have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situationbr br The Australian news media if this movie is to be believed devoured the case of a possible infanticide and truth was left as an afterthought It was scary to see the scenes of invasive swarming media hordes ridiculous accounts of halftruths and lies and debates over the supposed merits of the case by persons at all levels of societybr br Equally appalling is the medias depiction as indifferent and uncomprehending of the technical information in the case I do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case the accused are SevenDay Adventistsbr br Today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more importantbr br Streep is excellent as usual and this is the best Ive ever seen Sam Neill The Aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible
1	After a chance encounter on the train a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of Vienna discussing life and love The primary reason to see Before Sunrise is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines As Celine this sexy brainy soulful browneyed blond is sort of a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Joni Mitchell as they were in their midtwenties Risking overstatement Celine is practically the ideal woman unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural unpretentious introspective and selflessly loving We can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak for her sincere intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating Further her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks English with a French accent that is very endearing br br If there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar Ethan Hawke as Jessie comes off like a vaguely appealing slob sort of a Maynard G Krebs of the nineties Attempting to appear detached and nonchalant he sort of drags himself through certain shots His pants fit poorly his tee shirt is coming untucked his wavy dark hair his most attractive feature needs a good washing and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee Nevertheless he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a twoweek train ride around Europe so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine His oftcynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic Celine although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation When he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence we know he is getting somewhere br br After blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes bars and silly diversions they agree that because they may never see one another again they should make the most of it Jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up br br Given his boundless luck in the romance department it is especially irksome when Jessie as the very definition of a naive jerk foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp He contents himself with a halfbaked plan quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu to reunite at the same spot in half a year When the appointed time comes you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another perhaps even married and pregnant For whatever reason she probably wont show while Jesse who ends up working at Target or if hes lucky the local library will go back to Vienna desperate to see her again only to wind up alonebr br Despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion Before Sunrise is a beautiful movie I highly recommend both it and the sequel Before Sunset
1	This film really deserves more recognition than its getting It really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties favours and allegiances within the crime world The film is shot beautifully and delves into all youre classic crime themes such as betrayal and power This film is a movie goers film it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end It is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china It features an arrangement of great characters actors and development although is fair to say I had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film ALl in all 810 Great plot characters but there are characters that dont stand out enough and the music didnt really get me going and at times i felt it didnt sync well with the actionthere is action by the way so it loses some points for that
1	This fabulous movie must be viewed knowing that millions scraped together 10 cents to see it and forget the gloomy daytoday economic conditions during the 30s Remember 10 cents bought a loaf of bread back then so this was a minor luxury for many people Its testimony to how Hollywood did its best to make the USA feel a little better about itself Youll note that with the studio system in Hollywood at the time many of the actors and actresses were typecast in similar movies eg James Cagney William Powell Ruby Keeler Frank McHugh Joan Blondell and Guy Kibbee Then too branches of the US military were always respected with enthusiasm and patriotism as in the use of military precision marching by the great choreographer Busby Berkeley at the end
0	Its funny Ive seen a bunch of Fassbinder films and I have found some to be extremely creative and interesting while others are repellent and selfindulgent messeslike this film For me it ranges from great to crapwithout much in the middle I know he has a lot of fans among the sophisticated but I cant help but think that a lot of his appeal is pure hype From my point of view and I know I will get a lot of negative ratings for this he made too many movies too quickly and was too selfindulgent His gay or genderbending films like this one tend to be really badsloppily done sometimes quite boring such as QUERELLE and THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT and sometimes just gross like this film Couldnt his message about acceptance of a persons genderconfusion be handled better than showing him get slapped around or watching cows being gruesomely slaughtered Show some sensitivity for the subject matter and make your characters more human and sympatheticthen maybe Id care about the films br br Im honestly at the point after watching this film that I might not bother with any more Fassbinder filmsthe bad seems to be outweighing the good
1	I think James Cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies Anyway everyone remembers the RMS Titanic It was big fast and unsinkable until April 1912 It was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever Well James Cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship Well onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the filmbr br So our two main characters are Jack Leonardo DiCaprio and Rose Kate Winslet Theyre not annoying too much but watch this and youll find out why they could become annoying httptinyurlcomojhoyn The main villain I guess is bad luck fate hand of God no blasphemy intended or just plain Caledon Hockley Billy Zane Combine all of the above and what do you get Oh yes We get a love story on a sinking boat The supporting characters are the following My personal favorite Mr Andrews Victor Garberidk he was so nice LovejoyDavid Warner MurdochEwan Stewart Lightoller Jonathan Phillips Captain SmithBernard Hill Molly BrownKathy Bates and many more We also got the present day treasure hunter Brock Lovett Bill Paxton They add something to the story something good The action in here is awesome especially in the second half the drama as also good In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears The story is simple and it works A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately the fate of the ship Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws I give Titanic an 86 awesome
1	Footlight Parade is just one of several wonderfully jaunty musicals that Warner Bros produced in the early 1930s to ward off the Depression 42nd Street and the Golddiggers series were also produced during this era and they made literally millions of Americans forget their troubles for a little while and enjoy themselvesbr br While most of the films produced had the great talents of Joan Blondell Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell only Foolight Parade had the incomparable James Cagney Almost ten years prior to his most wellknown musical Yankee Doodle Dandy Here he dances in that most original of dance styles with his arms usually lowered at his side and his legs doing all types of undulations and kicks Its easy to see that he is enjoying himself and that makes us enjoy him all the morebr br While almost all of the musical sequences appear at the end of the film they are well worth the wait I believe that this film was made just prior to the installation of the production code so some of the costumes and scenes are a bit risqué But its all in funbr br It doesnt matter what the plot of the film is just know that there are plenty of laughs and a superlative cast Besides those already mentioned Guy Kibbee is at his flustered best herebr br 7 out of 10
0	I thought that this movie was pretty lame If youre looking for cheesey you may like this I myself dont mind a fair amount of cheese but this was ridiculous The progression of the movie bored me and the storyline was very weakbr br The only thing entertaining about this movie was the dayglo zombies but even that isnt reason enough to see this flick
0	Yes Kazaam is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies but with humanity Here we have Shaq as a rapping genie yes a RAPPING genie where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits all ending in him in a Christlike pose with lots of light surrounding him So yeah expect really cheesy bits including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky and regrettably not knocking out the two main characters particularly the kid What might not be expected is that a film with a kid and Shaquille ONeill would be so incredibly schmaltzy The main plot of the film involves this kid played in that alltootypical and annoyingkid fashion by the greatgrandson of Frank Capra where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily who comes upon a genie whos been trapped in a boombox Then hiarity ensues as the kid makes the Shaqgenie his quasislave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shadygangtype absentee fatherbr br This really sappy contrived son and father story would be bad enough as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies ie the two chances in life speech from father to son But its Shaquille ONeill who is both the reason to watch the film ironically and the obvious sinking crux of it all His plot line involves him when not getting the overtalky treatment from Capra to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career On top of this he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boombox So is there a camp factor to the movie Up to a point but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and heartfelt moments that have really no business with the rest of the material One might ask if the people making the movie who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a BASKETBALL player who wanted to go on the Michael Jordan acting bandwagon if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing Id hope that they too knew they were just getting paid But Id hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the Shaqmachinebr br So if you want to have a fun night of Shaq as genieturnedrapperturnedwisecracker all the more fun to you Hell it might even be interesting to have a Shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort Steel But if youre hoping to keep a few brain cells stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of 1996 and a candidate among many others for worst of the 90s
1	In my years of attending film festivals I have seen many little films like this that never get theatrical distribution and they end up in the 3 bins at WalMart I just found DVD of Yank Tanks there great doc but how sad for it to end up as a rockbottom remainderbr br I loved this film wish Id seen it at the cinema in its everything Id have preferred that New Yorker Films had translated the title directly Its good for Americans to stretch a little If the films title helps the US audience to explore random chaos all the better Cinema imitates life visa versabr br Also I found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars Come on The euro is not hard to figure out make the gringo audiences do the math Seeing a film especially one shot in Paris the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by being reminded I am an American watching a movie and they are translating the Euros into dollars for me br br Looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer director as well
0	SPOILERS AHEADbr br This is one of the worst movies ever made its that simple There is not one redeeming quality about this movie The first 10 minutes are quite tricky they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat Instead you will spend 83 minutes punching yourself while watching stolen and poorly made scenes run without any organization The lake was ridiculous looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed Characters show their advanced teleportation powers for example Alex Thomas who falls into the lake drunk and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position Angie Harmon put up a pitiful performance as Kate made worse by the spacetime continuum rupturing dialog that appears to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader An example of this would be when she said Flashlight in such a stupid manner that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it snaps in half Finally the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrific that I have ever seen It was like the cameramen were a bunch of chimps who had been given camcorders by scientists An example of this would be when we suddenly get a closeup of the headlight on Alexs car I would bet that there was little to no time spent editing this movie The ending was absolutely pathetic The writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say oh yeah Instead were left to view some dumb painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story line Unfortunately there is not one perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a festering piece of crapbr br I give this a 5 out of 10 the 5 being from the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book
1	After seeing several movies of Villaronga I had a pretty clear opinion about him he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters forgetting about a rhythm of the movie That is why though having good critics his movies never caught the broad audience attention In ARo he follows the same line but really improved on the rhythm especially in the end of the movie Frankly speaking I slept through the first part cause though the first part gives necessary information it is really slow Nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by Villarongabr br Recommended

1	This was a favorite of my childhood I can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time Now that Im grown up and have a kid of my own I wanted to introduce him to this classic movie We watched it last Friday and he liked it During Abus fight with the giant spider my sons hand crept over and took hold of mine he was genuinely scared Is he gonna beat the spider Poppa Just watch youll see He has no historical frame of reference to speak of eight years old so Bagdad under the grandson of Haroun alRaschid might as well be Oz under Ozmabr br I think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derringdo were perpetrated by the boythief and not the grownup king In fact if you deconstruct the films narrative a bit the king is the thiefs sidekick not the hero at all which must be very satisfying to imaginative adventurous young boys br br Its definitely a period piece I suspect that by the time hes eleven or twelve my son will find it corny or whatever word the next generation will be using by then The love story is barely onedimensional as a cynical friend commented Why does Ahmad love the Princess Because the narrative demands it The willingness of Abu to put himself in jeopardy repeatedly for the clueless lovestruck deposed king is equally improbable But to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses fiftyfoot genies and the Temple of the AllSeeing Eye would be fatuous in the extreme The satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movies climax is tremendous as is the final shot of Abu triumphantly flying away on his stolen magic carpet seeking some fun and adventure at last
1	Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material and almost always under appreciated Hes been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero and has the type of strong solid presence that Wallace Beery did half a century before him Baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor and thats whats so great about him He really seems to mean what hes saying regardless of how cliché obvious or silly which puts him in a league with Tommy Lee Jones Oliver Reed and Don Stroud Its what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy work so well and that same magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE This was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era By moving the action from Texas to Europe theres a real timeless quality that doesnt jar you away from the action on screen To be honest Ive always enjoyed the films of Greydon Clark who is a nononsense director in the same vein as 1970s Clint Eastwood and this is one of his best FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost gems of the late 80s similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true grit and violence I suppose if they remake this with The Rock a whole new audience will come to love it as much as I do
0	The saddest part of this is the fact that these are 87 minutes Ill never get back I knew this was terrible from the getgo with the guy dressed as a lunatic Indian chief on top of the roof See if they could get away with that in 2008 My 10yearold boy is really into baseball right now so we decided to rent it on a rainy day Even though he seemed to enjoy parts of it I had to cringe when I heard all the needless foul language Bad bad movie This was an awful ripoff of Bad News Bears Completely shameless and completely predictable I dont mind a predictable movie if its done well but this one absolutely was not
0	I wasnt terribly impressed with Dantes 1st season offering in Homecoming it wasnt much of a horror story but rather a smart political statement with the undead Screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes mens sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women The episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists Then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home I assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak but is unclear because this is never revisited The episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blahIt seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end The worst episode Well except for chocolate
1	It might be a little erroneous to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films but I think its the best way to give an approximation of the place Election occupies in the gangster genre arena It works somewhere in between The Godfather and Kinji Fukasakus yakuza opus The Yakuza Papers AKA Battles Without Honour and Humanity in that it is simultaneously both romanticized and realistic dark and gritty But its also a Johnnie To film and as such it carries the distinct touch of the Hong Kong auteurbr br Every two years the HK Triad elects a new boss Only this time one of the candidates is not overly happy with the result so he decides to take matters into his own hands much to the dismay of the rest of the Triads and the police Thats the story in a nutshell but rest assured it has a lot more going for it than that As in The Yakuza Papers theres a great deal of scheming backstabbing and forming and switching of allegiances sometimes all it takes is a phone call in one of the most memorable scenes Ive seen in recent time which might not necessarily make for deep drama but makes for an interesting plot and good character conflict Fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect Election is not as actionoriented as one might expect although it IS violent And Im not talking about the glossy glamour version of Hollywood violence This is dark and grim Tos camera lingers in the scenes of people being brutalized in ways that reveal both the humanity and inhumanity of the perpetrators and victims after all violence IS an integral part of us whether we like it or notbr br If youre familiar with Tos style then you should know what to expect The pacing is relatively slow and deliberate The cinematography is great slick and dark in equal measures utilizing dark hues brown dark green and orange while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it In the end Election occupies a peculiar place Its not exactly a character study and its not an actionoriented gangster film It explores a situation the election and its aftermath but does so in style and is both realistic and romanticized the Triad ceremonies in particular echo of an oriental Godfather

1	This movie is the first of Miikes triad society trilogy and the trilogy kicks of to a great start The movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically and these themes are actually apparent in all his films if you look close enough Shinjuku Triad Society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders struggling their way to the top of Tokyos yakuza The kid brother is a lawyer and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one as the movie progresses The movie takes place in a very harsh environment and is therefore pretty violent and tough Miike has done worse but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard As usual there is also a lot of perverted sex mostly homosexual in this one The movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie but with a great drive and true grittiness If youve only seen Miikes farout movies Ichi the killer Fudoh etc this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive overthetop style displayed in those movies and his more serious side as seen in the other films of the trilogy And as always with Miike there are at least two scenes in this that youll NEVER forget see it and figure out which ones for yourselfbr br 810
1	This is a true story of an Australian couple wha are charged with murder when their infant child disappears Meryl Streep is excellent as always and manages to hold our interest even though she plays a character who isnt particularly likablebr br The media frenzy that surrounded this case in Australia is reminiscent of the Sam Sheppard murder case in Ohio during the 50s These reallife situations demonstrate that the media in fact can affect how a criminal case is handled I well remember the Cleveland Plain Dealer running a huge headline stating Why Isnt Sam Sheppard in Jail The prosecutor eventually succumbed to this relentless pressure and Sheppard was tried and convicted Only after years in jail was he exoneratedbr br I love movies which tell a true story do it in an interesting way and make an important point in the process This is one of those movies Other good movies which tell the story of innocent persons charged with crimes include Hurricane The Thin Blue Line and Breaker Morant In particular the latter is another Australian film which is highly recommendedbr br 810
1	Walking the tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the toughest acts in cinema How do you get laughs out of other peoples misery and not start feeling bad when it goes on too longbr br Well this surprising little gem of a movie will deliver great big laughs beautiful scenery and quite a good buzz as well I particularly like the concept that a trick of history made alcohol legal since white Europeans liked it and marijuana illegal since those other races used itundoubtedly true and exposes a racial side to the marijuana laws so openly flaunted by populations all over the worldbr br An extraordinary DVD Extra commentarytwo of them in factrun thru the whole movie with both the actors and then again with the writers I kept seeing things I was sure were not in the first movie but then realizing how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first take What a hoot Dont miss it 910 stars
1	What can I say that hasnt been said about The Haunting It has everything that would make a great picture Wonderful sets moody music and sound design to die for were all in place The screenplay though sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird surrealistic way The entire team must have forgotten to read it through maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was Each member of the cast gives a worthy performance although with little conviction to the material at hand Lili Taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her But thats about it All I can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours but you will definitely want more A lot more
1	I watched this movie after seeing it on Broadway I love the Broadway musical and I love the movie I watched the movie like it was not related to the Broadway show I am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies so I developed a philosophy really early Assume that the movie is going to be based on the book or musical in this case but that while the story line may be similar it will not be the same it will be different so watch it for what it isbr br I danced for 12 years before I had to make a choice I was a good dancer picking up chorus work in local productions as a child etc but I wasnt super talentedI was however super talented as a show rider I was told by my dance instructor and my trainer who i spent several months a year at his farm out of state that I had to make a choice when I turned 14 That I needed to move up from dancing two hours fourfive days a week and riding 3 hours a day 7 days a week and dedicate to one or the other So I dearly love dancing and I love this movie and a lot of the other ballet and dance movies I just chose to watch this movie for what it is it is a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction It is about the power of anticipation and heartbreak when you work really hard to get something you want and you just do not get it I love the movie I love the Broadway musical

0	The film lacks style i mean original style everything looks copied including action first appearances in the movie songs dialog delivery etc etc Yes there the goofups were original like in the beginning a car is shown with number UP number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number MH That was one in many goofups of the movie Anything good in the movie yes for kareena fans if there are any Kareena in bikini For akshay fans his dialogs and action stunts Thats it nothing else So watch it on your own risk and dont blame the director or actors Director is already insane and actors i pity them

0	I discovered this movie with a retailer selling OOPs And this one surely is an OOP One year after The Exorcist shes back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of Blair never broke out she never became a mega star Thats one of the reasons many of her films are OOP She gives a good performance in this movie Its about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesnt have any friends Played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14 thats funny The movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity In most editions its cut out why I dont know no blood is involved okay Blair is butt naked but nothing is shown no TA so nothing to offend people But the movie is slow extremely slow It doesnt happy normally to me but I almost felt asleep Its just about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows no gore no nothing Why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me If youre a fan of Blair buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is
1	OK lets get this clear Im really not into scifi but for some reason I love Stargate SG1 br br Jack ONeil takes his team SG1 through a Stargate A round device that creates a wormhole It gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds It might sound like your usual scifiseries but its not The plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other scifiseries I find that great It gives you things happenings and such you can relate to and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets They have some of course but thanks to ONeil who likes to keep a simple terminology theres not many br br The series has a nice blending of action humor and drama If you enjoy loads of special effects youre not going to find it here They dont use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects
1	I enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of China in the 1930s in this beautiful film The story is simple An older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children The faces of the actors are marvelous to see The story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well The operas in the film remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE which was more sophisticated and intricate The story here reminds me of a Dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel The plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism humanity and history portrayed
1	I was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in England Ive seen hundreds of films sincebut Ive never forgotten this oneAlthough Sinatra was playing a not very endearing characterhe was excellent in the roleA lot of people seem to think that he didnt really come into his own until his role in From Here To Eternity but in my opinion he was magnificent in ConchoThe other role that sticks in my mind is that of William ConradId never see or heard of him before this film Conrad plays a terrific part in this filmI remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his characterAlso I remember the music that both introduces Conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appearsAn excellent film and my only disappointment was that I never ever got the chance to see it again It seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth I see in the titles that it says that the film is in black and white but when I saw it was indeed in full color I remember Sinatras blue shirt
0	This movie was so bad that my iq went down about 40 points after seeing it It made me wonder who could sit through the weeks it took to make it and think that it was worth it It must of been some kind of personal favor to Van Damme
1	If any movie stands out extremely with the actors acting skills this is probably the one Ive never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way but having a strong feeling The movie was disturbing at moments However the movie was terrible at editing The movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs yet they feel out of place Like Karisma is getting beat up and the same time SRK is fighting comically with the police officers The Ishq Kamina song was very out of place On top of that the movie is overly glossy in the beginning The direction was not bad but certainly nothing one can brag aboutbr br I have to say that the actors were chosen very wisely Without them this movie would not have an impact Karisma Kapoor has given her best role to date and this looks very good on her record after Zubeidaa and Fiza She looks pretty in the first half and Ive never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her What is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date Nana Patekar was excellent as her fatherinlaw Not much to say about him besides this is a role made for him Deepti Naval as the motherinlaw was excellent especially in her final scene Though she doesnt have much to say her facial expressions and body language was good The other good performance was the little kid He was adorable and is sure to bring tears to the viewers eyes The movie was probably saved desperately by their performances Sanjay Kapoor was all right but he didnt have much to do Shahrukh Khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role br br One thing that brought the audience to the theater was Ishq Kamina The song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song And boy Aish is mad hot However the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever People may have come to the movie for Aish but they wont brag too much about it afterwards Hum Tum Miley was properly paced but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie Damroo Bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about Dil Ne Pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie Despite the poor editing the performances alone make it a must see

1	I wouldnt call Were Back A Dinosaurs Story simply a kiddie version of Jurassic Park I found it more interesting than that Like the former it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours But it really opens my eyes when I see who provided the voices John Goodman Rhea Perlman Jay Leno Walter Cronkite Julia Child Kenneth Mars Yeardley Smith Martin Short and Larry King To paraphrase that a given actor the Cheers woman the Tonight Show host the Most Trusted Name In News a famous chef the Young Frankenstein police chief Lisa Simpson one of the Three Amigos and the CNN guybr br But I guess that I shouldnt focus only on the cast I thought that this movie had something for both children purely fun and adults natural history True its escapism but the perceptive kind I would actually say that John Goodman doing Rexs voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in Monsters Inc Worth seeing
1	I find it so amazing that even after all these years we are STILL talking about this movie Obviously this movie wasnt THAT bad or else people wouldnt even BOTHER to talk about it I personally enjoyed this film immensly and still do I guess this film isnt for everyone but it certainly did touch the hearts of many br br As for those that think that this film is overrated or overhypedwell we only have the moviegoing public to thank for that lol You see its not CRITICSarticle writers that make a film HUGE or a HIT with the general moviegoing public PEOPLE make the film a huge success With Titanic everyone was in awe Lets face it a film like this had never been made before At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912 Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched br br Give this movie a break you guys The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you that this was a gooddecentmovie worth seeing then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movienot once not twice but maybe 3 times and more So I really wouldnt say that this movie was overhypedat least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being overhyped ha Critics didnt even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Camerons gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film However the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more br br Personally I LOVE this film However this film might not be for everyone DOnt say that this film sucks just because of romance though THat is the most sexist thing Ive ever heard Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it The story was sweet The dialogue could have been better but lets face itthe REAL star of the movie wasnt Leo or Kateit was that GIGANTIC Ship I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job Its not thier best work Ive seen much BETTER work from both of them but it wasnt the WORST Ive seen on screen before Give them a breakbr br
1	A sweet little movie which would not even offend your Grandmother Saving Grace seems cut from the same cloth as a halfdozen other British comedies over the past two yearsunderdog is faced with adversity finds the strength to challenge and learns something about himherself in the processbr br Widowed and thus broke Grace is a master gardener and is enlisted to help her friendemployee Matthew grow his pot plant Hes been doing it all wrong so Grace helps him out They realize that she is the perfect person to harvest pot which they can both benefit from He enjoys smoking she needs to raise funds to pay her mortgage br br Highlight is Grace travelling to London to deal some of her merchandise dressed in what looks like the white suit John Travolta wore in Saturday Night Fever and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb br br Blethyn is always watchable and you cant say that about a lot of peoplewell I cant anyway Ferguson is very good and Tcheky Karyo who I liked in La Femme Nikita is memorable br br Not profoundly moving or insightful but immensely entertaining and at a brisk 90 minutes feels like a walk with friends 810
0	Last of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films and a good thing too as this is easily the worst of the 12 films he made over a period of 16 years No mermaids are featured here either as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the clutches of her people who worship a god and try to force her to be its bride She finds Tarzan and Jane who try to protect her George Zucco is present as a potentially villainous High Priest but isnt used to his full advantage Also on hand and worthy of mention is a hugely annoying guitar playersinger who goes into song every so often Even the great Robert Florey cant aid this onebr br 12 of four
1	its great i loved it ha cause i love dinosaurs they r the greatest animals but i loved the show cause it wasnt copied from another show and it was a originals ha it has a good storyline and great for little kids if they like dinosaurs that is i have a few downs too its not all that great cause of the dinosaurs look a little mutated so i should have had but a 7 but right now is a little late for that yay 4 more lines to go it is great for a fantasy show though warning this might spoil a part for u so if u dont want it to be spoiled dont read on plz near the end is kinda weird cause all they need to do is get dang i forgot what it was so nvm guess its not a spoiler so never mind i loved it and its my opinion and sorry for any missed spelled words if any
0	Horrible acting horrible cast and cheap props Wouldve been a lot better if was set as an action parody style movie What a waste Starting from the name of the moviebr br The Enemy Naming it Action Movie wouldve made it better contributing to the parody effect The cop looking like a 60 Year old player the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times Towards the end of the movie him and her are working together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie Horrible Dont waste your time
1	Well Ill be honest It is not exactly a Sholay But you cant get a Sholay every week In fact you could see distinct signatures of not without my DaughterSally Field 1991 in this movie However as most inspired movies go this one was a wellinspired one well handled and well done Nana Patekar as usual tends to overdo his hysterics but all others are commendable Specially so about Dipti Naval Saw her after a long time but she hasnt lost any of her grace In fact she has performed much better that when I last saw her Another one of the Bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they agebr br All in all a nice watch
1	The first and second seasons started off shakily with good episodes sandwiched in between average ones and at times resorting to clichéd stories But once it started to set up the universe in which it exists and started to develop its characters more it became a lot more fun and entertaining br br The main reason this show succeeds it because of four men Richard Dean Anderson Peter Deluise Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie Richards dry sense of humour makes to show so much better Peters directing is excellent and makes any episode so much more entertaining and Joe Paul never fail to make a funny interesting episode together br br Once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters I doubt you wont like the show For those getting into the show I suggest the episodes The Other Side a good serious episode and Window of Opportunity a classic comic relief episode

1	Masks is a moving film that works on many levels At its simplest it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art masks to the next generation Although at times the story makes the old man into a Job it is so well crafted written acted directed wonderful production values it is easy to move beyond his plight And if you hang with it the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting Kudos all around This is a wonderful film for children as well as adults The trick is how to get Americans who may not like foreign language films to see it
0	I loved the first season The quality went down a little bit in the second season which however had a great middle Pegasus Third season was fairly novel and original and was OK Fourth season started going downhill fast because they never even began giving us any explanations when by now we were really starting to need them What the hell was the Cylon plan Why were there two Cylon factions What was the point of AngelKara leading the fleet to a devastated Earth1 What kind of a past did the last five Cylons have and how did they survive or were they reincarnations Questions everywhere answers nowherebr br And then comes the end Earth2 our Earth in the past Well okay But destroying the fleet Giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life and spreading a few thousand people paperthinly across the planet Thats not only antiscience its antireason and antilife And the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive AI that ruins everything It is without vision without hope for a grander future for humanity and it is antithetical to proper science fiction And dont even get me started on the angels Religious claptrap of the worst kind The ultimate disappointmentbr br The whole all this has happened before and will happen again thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series not just to Earth as we know it Making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius Frakkin shamebr br 1 out of 10
1	Johnnie Tos ELECTION has some cool music on the opening creditsand a nice opening credits design too a kaleidoscope of Chinese characters and those Asian mobsters solemnly taking an oath or uttering some sacred stuff as a matter of fact the whole flick is nicely scored I have found about To from Bishop Seraphim Sigrist and was quite eager to see a To movie The one with which I began ELECTION is exciting and interesting and only moderately violent by nowadays standardsmoderately and also essentially violent the story of an Asian godfathers scheming it uses a puzzle play of elements violent facts from the mobsters lives the race for the scepter true details and as with Coppola we are expected to believe that some of the morally glamorized mobsters are entitled and nice and likable The performances are reasonably amusing and colorfulbr br ELECTION is well made in the enjoyable somewhat careless style of the Hong Kong fare the ending is bitter true straight and will scare the kids
1	This film is definitely an odd love story Though this film may not be much to shout about Nicole Kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten though Ben Chaplin does do quite a good job of Hertfordshire Life with shots of St Albans Hemel Hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area What starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular British TV seriesHeartbeat soon turns into a gritty gangster getaway action flickNothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus endsup as fairly decent weekend entertainment A good one to watch and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character
0	Ill give writerdirector William Gove credit for finding someone to finance this illconceived thriller A good argument for not wasting money subscribing to HBO let alone buying DVDs based on cover art and blurbs A pedestrian Dennis Hopper and a game Richard Grieco add nothing significant to their resumes although the art direction is not half bad The dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit this is storytelling at its worst No tension no suspense no dread no fear no empathy no catharsis no nothing A few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer I feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing Good for latenight zonedout viewing only You have been warned
1	This movie is far better than the original The Jerk I would highly recommend it to anyone who like quirky humor We have incorporated almost as many lines from this movie into our daytime discourse as we have from Monty Pythonbr br The card game with the hobos and then with Mr Suicide The scene at the dinner table and his distaste for turtle soup The original The Jerk was too choreographed ans staged While I like Steve Martin he seemed like he was trying to hard The Jerk Too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone The Jerk Too is family friendly unlike the original The Jerk
0	Dont let the MPAA fool you with their Rated R for extreme violence there is definatly no extreme violence in this boring peice of st I expected some cheap rambo 3 type action that the trailer promised however its just boring boring nonsense with tons of lame slow mo flashbacks that make no sense AVOID
1	Friz Frelengs Rumours is an excellent Private Snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panicinducing rumours during wartime Produced as were all the Snafu shorts to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films Rumours is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan When Snafu starts a rumour about a bombing it escalates into an eventual rumour that America has lost the war This is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long rubbery piece of baloney and several strange fictional creatures who come back to haunt Snafu with ever more terrible news about his countrys military Rumours is inventive fast paced and funny all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured dont badmouth the military message It stands up as one of the best of the Private Snafu shorts
1	This is one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen I love the backwoods feel of this movie The movie is very realistic and believable This seems to take place in another era maybe the late 60s or early 70s Henry Thomas works well with the young baby Very moving story and worth a look
0	I cant say this is the worst film of all time but only because there are still some movies I havent seen yet This has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time The director suffers from the same issues he had with There Will Be Blood though he wasnt quite as bad in that film The whole movie it feels like youre watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities Its like he sits in his little directors chair and thinks how would a great filmmaker handle this scene He just doesnt have it in him I dont know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker There were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished but nothing was brought to ripen The scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history One by one as we see the characters singing and I squirmed in my seat I kept saying please PLEASE just dont have the guy on the brink of death singing too Sure enough MASSIVE FAILURE
0	The first part of Grease with John Travolta and Olivia Newton John is one of the best movie for teens This one is a very bad copy The change is only in the sex In the first one the good one was Sandy here its Michael I prefer to watch the first Grease
1	one of the funnest marios ive ever played the levels are creative there are fluid controls and good graphics for its time theres also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight Sometimes the levels get frustrating and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still need to get more accomplished to fight a boss it can be annoying another complaint is the camera angle though it works fairly well most of the time it can be a pain in certain situations if your a big time mario fan this ones for you even if your not a huge fan of him id still recommend this one its a big game and getting what you need can take a while but its very satisfying good for playing in short bursts of time it will almost certainly hold your interest it sure does hold mine
0	The worst movie I have seen in quite a while Interesting first half with some engaging terse dialogue among dubious characters in a latenight bar The movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock read disgust without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything elsebr br I wanted to walk out but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect Still time is precious as the director himself observed in his intro and I really begrudge the time I wasted on the second half of this onebr br Saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie especially the female lead
0	ive discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging the zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary then you get to the movie and its women with raccoon masks on zero special effectsand even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by 2 feet the funny thing is that Lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie the only thing i can think is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a cult classichowever i cant possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made the real horror in this film is how bad it is im embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another Lommel film again
1	This is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes THE MONEY PIT and ARE WE DONE YET only points out all the more how the 40s movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since regretfully been lostbr br I was 15 when I first saw this and even at that tender age there was much I could laugh at Now of course being familiar with adult frustrations I see a whole lot that I missed as a youthbr br The three main actorsCary Grant Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglasinteracted perfectly but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream Its never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisionsbr br All in all this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it
1	Dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictive film making The storyline across the 4 parts blends mindless action slapstick humor touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions Its hard to believe that there was only one director as the style changes from episode to episode A mustsee movie for anyone who likes anime
1	Though structured totally different from the book by Tim Krabbé who wrote the original The Vanishing Spoorloos it does have the same overall feel except for that Koolhovens style is less businesslike and more lyric The beginning is great the middle is fine but the sting is in the end A surprise emotional ending As you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film but it is done all very beautifully Never explicit but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour It is a shame American films cant be as open an honoust as this one Where Dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject De Grot stays always within the boundaries of good taste De Grot tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years When youll leave the cinema youll be moved What can we ask more of a film Anyway this film even gives more
0	This show made me feel physically sick and totally detached from British society as a whole It was programmes such as this and Blue Peter that pretended that there wereare no class divisions in Britain Theyd always say things like Go into your loft and you may find this or Go into your back garden tonight and what about us scummy working class kids who never never had a loft and a back garden which was nothing more than a 1 meter square of balcony on the 14th floor of a council block Public service broadcasting yeah right And on top of that it was awfully depressing to see those stupid middle class uptheirownbackside kids mess about with bits of old plastic having fun do me a favour and why dont you go and slit your wrists or do a coke overdose on Mama and Papas money you make me sick
0	I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it The movie however did not meet my expectations Having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies The characters didnt seem to fit very well with the book The direction was weak I had a hard time getting into the characters There wasnt a real connection with the viewer about what was going on The dialog didnt explain adequately what was happening It just seemed slapped together and rushed through All in all I was very disappointed with the movie I suppose if you havent read the book it might be ok by itself At the very least it might entice you to read the book which youll probably enjoy morebr br
1	This movie rewrote film history in every way No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie because it transcends criticism Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it It is an extremely beautiful movie and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again Ive seen it more times than I care to count and I still become transfixed every time with a feeling which is hard to describe One for the ages
0	Have not watched kids films for some years so I missed Here Come the Tigers when it first came out Never even saw Bad News Bears even though in the 70s I worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie Warriors Man Who Would Be King and Rocky Horror Picture Show among others Now I like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on Just minutes into this movie I could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better thingsat least watching for hisher appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting werent doing the job Lo and behold I spied Wes Cravens name in the credits as an electrical gaffer Hed already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created Freddie Krueger or made the Scream movies Maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic More surprising was Fred J Lincoln in the cast credits as Aesop a wacky character in the movie FJ Lincoln from the 70s to just a few years ago appeared in and produced adult films He was associated with the adult spoof The Ozporns and just that title is funnier than all of Tigers attempts at humor combined Let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel
1	This incredibly formulaic flick from the Walker Texas Ranger squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a TV movie In addition one can pretty much predict the outcome from the getgo However its a fun little movie that gets the job done it entertains Thats all it was meant to do and it does so The stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isnt half bad The acting is also decent which isnt much of a surprise because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is no Steven Seagal If youre a fan of the genre and of Walker Texas Ranger you will definitely love this If not then dont waste your time 810
0	this movie is outrageous by outrageous i mean awful i had more fun watching the paint dry at my local hardware store on an august day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke the acting got progressively worse as the movie advanced and the directors use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached when misty was shot to death she decided that it would be prudent to blink post mordem that was not intelligent truthfully stevie wonder could have caught that with his eyes closed if you are deciding between playing with a nail gun while intoxicated and watching this movie bear in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends
0	Waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand I expected an interesting scifi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robottechnology instead I went disappointed by each aspect of it once more proving that stunning special effects cant help a boring plot which by my opinion was the worse in this year Acting in this movie also dissatisfied me Will Smith didnt show anything new in this movie yet I never saw his acting to change since Men In Black which was his only success by my opinion He had to retire since than not spoiling his name with titles like IRobot and Men In Black 2 410
0	In spite of its impressive cast and crew pedigree Gingerbread Man crumbles early and often The plot is unrealistically convoluted the actors sport bad accents and director Robert Altmans participation amounts to collecting a pay check Once again he has assembled an impressive cast Like Woody Allen everyone wants to work with Altmanthat this time around to the letter is miscast But thats only part of the problembr br Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder a high powered Georgia lawyer who in the films heavy handed opening scenes manages to get himself preposterously seduced by a mysterious catering company waitress who convinces him she is in grave danger from an exhusband and a loony dad With red flags everywhere the astute lawyer plods on even managing to get his children in harms way Fights of gun and fist follow along with a requisite car chase and if thats not enough theres a hurricane thrown in for the ridiculous finalebr br Branagh plays MacGruder with a mealy and unconvincing Southern accent Running around in a trench coat in all kinds of weather hes blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going Hipster Bob Downey Jr is every bit as bad as a PI but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent Robert Duvall as the old man is Boo Radely all growed up en crazier than a bed bug serving some thick slices of ham but at least his twang is plausible The female leads Embeth Davidtz Darryl Hannah Famkhee Jansenare lean leggy and unemotive Even the celebrity lawyers doing cameos Vernon Jordan are wooden with the few throw away lines they havebr br In addition to paying little attention to his actors Altmans mise en scene dripping with Spanish moss is murky and shapeless his action scenes comic book It lacks his offbeat touches and observations he does inform the viewer that the Stars and Bars still wave in Georgiathat make a well done Altman so unique Unfortunately Gingerbread Man is Altman at his worst even if the pay is the same
1	Of course I would have to give this film 10 out of 10 as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of Once upon a Crime Rodolfo Sonego wrote screenplays for over 50 years living in Italy He was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing So Rodolfo Sonego did If you check out his biography you can see the number of movies that have been made in Italy Alberto Sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories My uncle visited Australia and my town in 1968 to check out locations for A girl in Australia and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war You can see his humor in all his movies I found a copy of this movie on DVD recently GREAT
1	Jeopardy has the feel of being a stock movie of sorts one of the movies that the studios pumped out inbetween big budgetbox office ones Its a mere 70 minutes and doesnt feature many sets and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck But what a star of course br br Stanwyck is a tough lady once again as she runs into an escaped convict while seeking help for her trapped husband in the Mexican desert The majority of the movie is focused on how she deals with her captor who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help Some psychological battling there br br Its a surprisingly effective little movie its short length makes it taut and that Stanwyck is great should go without mention but Ill still praise her every time
0	pokemon the movie was a terrible film unlike the first one this is not a good film at all the graphics were decent but the story was flat and no real drama was built up in it in the first one the interaction between the characters were decent the subtraction of brock and addition of tracey was bad tracey really doesnt have much to say or do and unlike brock offers no comic relief the only good points is you get to see misty actually get jelous over ash and her early brooding over being called his girlfriend was entertaining overall this film isnt worth renting and the short movie before didnt do anything for me or my wife and we do consider ourselves pokemon fansoh well maybe the next one will be bettercant ge t much worse
0	This is available on a Drive In Double Feature from Dark Sky Films and since I just had finished up Barracuda I watched this too This is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same timebr br We begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town but where exactly are they They stop to look at necklaces from some Chinese vendor and try on Chinesestyle clothes at a shop but then we see some Aztec dancers And all the while these girls are being followed by two guys who eventually drop whatever stealth they didnt have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town and they finally catch thembr br It seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck and these guys want to find the loot and where did she get it So in flashback we go back to find out And how did they know she had this coin Hard to say reallybr br Now back in the day when these two women were 10 years old they were out with their sisters and their sisters boyfriends on a boat and after stopped to get air in their tanks they tow this young boy back to his home dock only to have his grandpa come out invite the young uns up for herbal tea with granny But not everyone has the tea Todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls and then when theyre away from it the boat blows up and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared Well it seems as though these kindly folk raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell and serve it herbal teabr br But the girls and Todd did leave the island but now theyre returning escorted by their captors and theyre there to find the treasure despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was BEFORE There also seems to be someone else on the island and the thugs mysteriously begin to die one by one and since theres only three it doesnt take long And theres even a sort of happy ending which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the filmbr br The two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues and combined with no acting ability theyre borderline hilarious The hillbillytype family is also devoid of acting ability despite the fact that the grandpa is Hank Worden who appeared in many films and TV shows The action is confusing the locales are even more confusing and the island looks like Southern Californiabr br So what the hell IS this Im not sure but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think or say huh 4 out of 10 very bizarre
1	Saving Grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoonwhen you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun I meanthe whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness It was the first movie I watched with this themedrugsmarijuana that is not really criticizing itonly making jokes about it Grace Trevethyn is a widowwho lives in a small town in UK and has many financial problems because of her dead husband who committed suicide since he was full of debts The problem is that Grace who imagined to have some money saved for her discovers that she needs to pay all of her husbands pounds in debts to not lose all of her things specially her house that she loves so much She never worked before and is in a tragic situation until Matthewher gardener who is very found of smoking pot decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale
0	this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any REAL evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example Bart Sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldnt there be two or more shadows for each object when Apollo 11 went through the van Allan radiation belts they spent 30 Mins there not the 90 Mins claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x raybr br seriously do some research learn what really happened dont let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened
1	Outragously entertaining period piece set in the 30s it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series as much as Raiders of the Lost Ark only done on a low budget and much campier by director Michael Anderson The opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau predating Batman by two decades Starring Ron Ely Tarzan as a perfectly cast hero and the gorgeous Pamela Hensley as the local latina Mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the nonexistent latin american country of Hidalgo Best line our hero to Mona holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug Mona youre a brickbr br Paul Wexlers hamandcheese blackhat Captain Seas is a an absolute delight Expect a little Raiders a dash of Batman a little The Lost World a little Lost Horizons and a whole lot of campiness and youll get it just right Watch out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of John Philip Sousas patriotic music A prime candidate for DVD release it is certainly overdue An unmissable treat for the whole family 910
1	I initially bought this DVD because it had SRK and Aishwarya Rai on the cover and I thought hey another film starring Aishu and Shah Rukh little did I know that Aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with SRK and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just 15 minutes Shakti is a film about a mothers love and endurance Its a film about transformations ignorance coming of age stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life The item number in which SRK and Aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie Its actually a dream sequence that occurs while SRKs drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze He dreams that Aishwarya Rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day dressed scantily and begins to seduce him The title of the song is Ishq Kamina loosely translated as Loves a bitch and it is just plain smoking hot Dont miss it
1	Excellent view of a mature woman that is going to lose everything even the pruner has a mortgage The way she gets involved into this special business the innocence and the true love that exists between the people of a little town its mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh light and funny comedy I couldnt stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstorebr br I love European films and with movies like this one my opinion grows stronger A movie that I also recommend with my eyes closed in this same genre is Waking Ned Devinebr br Saving Grace a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself You will love it
1	First off this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema apparently its the other way around If one were to look back after the film it really wasnt meant to be convincing it was a low budget ipecac But really thats all it was aiming for it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original VHS versions br br I gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific in nonshock sense it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoidpessimistici didnt trust anyone for about a week because i didnt want to wake up strung up and tortured
1	In order to stop her homosexual friend Albert Perry King from being deported back to Belgium Stella Meg Foster decides to marry him The only other problem with that is that Stella herself is a lesbian The two have their separate lives when one night after Alberts birthday party they fall into bed and then into love Later in the film after falling in love Stella suspects Albert of cheating and shows up at his job one night late after closing What she finds will leave the viewer stunned This is a great film very original Perry King and Meg Foster are so good in their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here Very controversial upon its release in 1978 the R rated film is now PG in this much more liberal timebr br Recently released on DVD the disc contains a Making Of segment on the special features and in it its stated that the film was based on an actual story so the viewers who say the film is not real are mistaken Everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasonsthese are the issues explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved
0	To be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes Muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the Exact opposite I realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a Muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesnt mean it is a terrorist thing It also shows how people give the Muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad Muslims out it doesnt mean we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time like how hard it was for Amair to get on a plane and how he used words like Blow up or Yaser saying well blow away the competition and people took it the wrong way Being a Muslim i know that stuff like this dont usually happen but they do and many people think bad things about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq its not right things are not like that people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act I am glad a show like this came on the air There are many shows that Piotr Muslim people as terroristsmany people do find them funny to my opioion it is OK to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair but it is done to often and really gives Muslin people a bad name
0	Predictable hackneyed poorly written Foolishly I reasoned such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit I guess competition amongst actors is so intense these days and will only get worse that one cannot pick and choose much any more Early on we were given an inkling who was was instrumental in the assassination and we had it rammed down our throats ever since The movie lacked intrigue giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder Some of the discourse was frankly embarrassing Its hard to believe anyone would even consider let alone commit to the spending of tens of millions of dollars to make this tripe
0	The Earth is destined to be no more thanks to Father Pergado and a bunch of Nuns Christopher Lee who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved is Father Pergado and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine The cast are not too bad though most have now retired from acting The film has terrible sound effects mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems and it ridiculously pondering at times showing a scene of the sky for instance for what feels like hours at a time Despite this the story is pretty humorous in a worldisdoomed sort of way and the production is adequate Interestingly one scene features Albert Band and wife Jackie Meda Band Writer Frank Ray Perilli and Charles Bands assistant Bennah Burton Despite its plodding nature I genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it
1	Nothing is fantastic Simple as that Its a film that shouldnt work yet does Natali stays in the realm of SciFi however this film is also a comedy Cypher it seemed was a big budget draining affair for Natali at 75million Woohoo Pa so with Nothing he scales down again This is low budget independent filmmaking at its best Simple good old fashioned storytelling and an attempt at making a film for artistic merit as apposed to Hollywoods usual reasons for mostly financial gain Nothing is a film about Nothing and before you ask no it is not anything like Seinfeld Basically Andrew and Dave are a couple of losers They live in a strange looking house beneath two freeways Andrew is a telesales travel agent who is agoraphobic while Dave is Andrews best mate who stays with him rent free to help him out Dave is tired of it however and has a gorgeous girlfriend who he wants to move in with By bizarre misfortunes however Dave finds out his girlfriend embezzled a huge amount of money from Daves workplace incriminating Dave and Andrew is wrongly accused of sexually assaulting a girl scout Canadian humour people As it turns out Andrews house is to be demolished as well and he cant stop it happening as the house was built on land it should not have been built on Both Andrew and Dave are inside the house when the police and the demolition team come calling They are desperate and cant escape and in the panic and confusion just as the police burst in everything fades to white What has happened Have Dave and Andrew died They wake to find themselves still in the house only it is quiet No police no demolition team no angry girl scout mother What happens is Dave and Andy discover they have the ability to wish or hate away As it turns out they have hated away the entire outside world They are left alone The house is surrounded by nothing which is portrayed as pure white So what this means is that the films setting is a house set and then just white The film is an interesting view on human isolation and the psyche and of course as they spend more time alone together with no food and no water they begin to tire of each other They discover they can hate away hunger which is useful but obviously things get out of hand shall we say I cant reveal much but I must say bouncing heads are quite a sight to beholdbr br This film is quirky funny interesting The effects are simple yet effective and Natali brings together two buddies from Cube David Hewlett and Andrew Millar to lead the film They have chemistry and also work very well They have to hold 90 of the movie by themselves and much of it in a pure white background yet it works Certainly I expect this to get the same diabolical treatment as Cypher did and it should appear on DVD in a year or two in the states Nothing is a top quality and unique film and although not as good as Cube or Cypher it once again proves Natali as one of the best up and comersbr br Natali is someone who has really interested me in his three features so far and I cannot wait for his next feature I prey to god he doesnt do the proposed Necropolis written and directed by ADD sufferer the ever crap Paul Anderson Vincenzo old buddy if Paul comes round to your pad RUN RUN LIKE THE WIND I hope and prey this guy doesnt take to Hollywood like Alex Proyas did with the enjoyable yet pussyfooted sugar coated helium light I Robot Keep your eyes peeled for this guy

0	When I was 11 Grease 2 was like crack It was a classless shameful euphoric and powerfully addictive experience My sister and I would watch it rewind it and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another So if you are an 11year old girl and you reviewed this film as brilliant or fun or better than the original Grease you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will passbr br If however you are not a little girl you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was anything but an inane artless slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production distribution andor consumptionbr br For the sake of criticism I will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows br br 1 In a wellexecuted musical the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters In Grease 2 with a few debatable exceptions to the music is obscenely pointless Most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way Score Tonight Reproduction Do It For Our Country and Prowlin without making one concrete statement about any of the films characters or themes Plus all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dancebr br 2 The Tbirds should be badass and if not at least somewhat likable but instead each of them is an annoying wussydufusloser In the end when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred Tbird jacket and initiates him into the gang Michael should kick it to the ground spit on it and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it But of course he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads there is no greater honor than to be one with the Tbirds br br 3 Since Michael is beautiful smart kind resourceful and above average in everyway his musical impotence notwithstanding it is feasible that Stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask Stephanie on the other hand is a slovenly slackjawed bubble gum smacking dirty sweatshirt wearing gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat So aside from being pretty I guess she harbors no likable characteristics thus audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of Michaels attraction to herbr br I could go on and on but I didnt want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair I will say this though to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old times sake Grease 2 is an experience akin to reliving your first kiss Only you are 32 now and kissing a snotnosed 13year old kid with acne and slobby braces The magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed Trust me
0	Yeah Im sure it really could be a nation if four of them all stood at the four corners of the world and the other two cloned themselves a few billion times Man I am REALLY glad that I saw this movie on FEARnet instead of renting it Im a big fan of the George Romero movies and Im pretty sure that if he saw this movie hed probably throw up while laughing too hard I mean what was with the raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like Charlies Devils It really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shoppolice stationapartmentflatwhatever room it was with the gong in the background and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop I couldnt even tell what nationality the killer was and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations didnt help either Oh well what can I expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world So for all of those who worship Mystery Science Theater 3000 or if you just like reaming on bad C movies C for Craptastic then this is the movie for you or not
1	Honestly when I saw this movie years ago I immediately wanted to turn it off As I sat there for the next 10 minutes or so I realized that the actor playing Navin stole the show His facial expressions and comedic demeanor makes me shake my head as to WHY he hasnt been in more comedies He has this Marty Feldman thing going for him but MUCH MUCH more talenttaking nothing away from Marty The movie really shocked me by how close it was to the original Jerk but then again it was SO MUCH MORE I really think that if this movie was released first and I saw the Steve Martin movie 2nd Id think the 2nd was a cheap ripoff I know it sounds like a BOLD statement but its true I actually like Steve Martin a great deal but his performance is 2nd to the actor in The Jerk Too I wish I could get a copy of it for my collection I urge you to see it if you can find it
1	Russell my fav is gorgeous in this film But more than that the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected The film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity Fabulous love story between Lachlin and Lil I replay their scenes over and over again Anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people All characters are cast and portrayed excellently
0	If you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of Alt305oklar as it is promised by the tag line you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of Alt305oklar regarding most famous issues like sex marriage and cheating To much nudity which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that Alt305oklar was unsuccessfully to try something new as he has quoted To much sex centered jokes seems to show that Alt305oklar had fallen for the famous saying which is sex sells I was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique However in the end I found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching Alt305oklars experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work
0	Apparently The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of selfmutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood I use the word apparently because without listening to a director Andy Copps commentary which I didnt have available to me or reading up on the film prior to watching viewers wont have a clue what it is aboutbr br Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling reallife footage but unless theyre also fond of pretentious headacheinducing experimental arthouse cinema theyll find this one a real chore to sit throughbr br 82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dischordant sound terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue this mindnumbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test ones sanity if youve still got all your marbles youll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead I watched the whole thing but am well aware that Im completely barking
1	Seeing this movie was the most fun Ive had at the cinema in a long time However I am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied This picture has everything any movie could ever have It has characteristics of a romantic comedy a political commentary a thriller a drama an action movie a musical and an absurdist selfconscious art film Its all in there adding up to a mythbr br The basic premise is about an Indian couple Nandini Karishma Kapoor and Shekhar Sanjay Kapoor happily living in Canada who rush to India to visit the husbands parents after a disturbing news report The rest of the story takes place in India where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence At one point the story borrows from Not without my baby but to call Shakti a remake of anything would be an injusticebr br The ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions including Shah Rukh Khans dream of Aishwarya Rai which comes as if out of another movie In fact the two stars are on all the posters but they appear really late in the film and only Shah Rukh ends up being a real character Yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performancebr br Karishma Kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film and she does an admirable job having to link up the films twists and turns with a show of believable emotion Another notable presence is Nana Patekar who plays Narsimha the tyrannical father of the husband Shekhar Nana Patekar dominates every scene hes in with a scary but nuanced characterbr br The movie is not without its share of realism Violence is rampant but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters with Karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions At times this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but catharticbr br I have seen a share of Bollywood releases and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm But Shakti raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous It is a film that achieves the grandeur of a Shakespearian tragedy where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained It is pure gratuitous cinema and the director Krishna Vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book Perhaps the allimportant message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind but I came out of watching Shakti exhilarated Making movies can be the most fun in the world

0	After being a big fan of the ten minute TV episodes of Stella Street I awaited this film with excitement and anticipation Unfortunately I was left feeling very disappointedbr br I was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the TV Episodes and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing as if the actors had said them once and couldnt be bothered to say them again I bought my copy on DVD and felt cheated that I had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over againbr br SPOILERS The plot of the film starts with Stella Street a normal English street in Surrey gradually being populated by some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years including Michael Caine Al Pacino Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones All the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people There are some nice moments but on the whole the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring END OF SPOILERSbr br In the TV Episodes all the characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell including females but in the film Ronni Ancona is added to the cast I think this was a mistake Her impersonations werent funny and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to dobr br If you were not a fan of the episodes of Stella Street you may find this film entertaining But if you were a fan I think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated 410

1	I chanced upon this movie because I had a free nonnew release from Blockbuster and needed to grab something quickly as the store was getting ready to close for the evening The plain white cover and title intrigued me Im a relatively speaking old lady and my son is a young man of 30 I adore movies that are sheer entertainment such as The Sixth Sense Interview With A Vampire Harry Potter and Beetlejuice My son on the other hand is a film graduate and enjoys very specialized foreign films such as those directed by Bergman or Hertzog We generally hate each others movie choices HOWEVER we both watched and LOVED the movie NOTHING It was unlike any movie wed ever seen before Were both cynicalcritical personality types and we usually crack on movies while we watch them but in this case we just laughed and enjoyed the film from start to finish It is our opinion that if this movie had been promoted and shown in the main stream theaters in the US it would have done very well indeed
0	This movie is like real life by which I mean not a lot happens in the available 2 hours or so and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast their invisibility being due to the experimental lighting as mentioned by many reviewers br br A big bore No big surprise that Altman helms this he is a very variable performer yes we all loved Gosford Park but Pret A Porter anyone Kansas City Dr T and the Women Aaargh but the fact that the raw material is a John Grisham tale and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film And no it is not so bad its goodbr br Its just bad
1	I watched the movie in a preview and I really loved it The cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious Another highlight of the movie is definitely the music which hopefully will be released soon I recommend it to everyone who likes the British humour and especially to all musicians Go and see Its great

0	Im sorry but even TJ Hookers Adrian Zmed couldnt save this sequel I went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original Then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene notice that this is the only movie that Patricia Birch directs and I sadly realized they were trying to be serious I did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang having lost their wheels due to their gambling habits in the original Grease were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie Being shamed by that putz character Carrington Id hate to see what they would resort to later maybe Mopedsbr br I also never bought the hackneyed theme hunkyAustralianboycantfitintoOutsidersdominatedschoolergogoesfor toughguywithstupidbikerhelmetlook It was Disney story gone horribly awrybr br So it looks like you CAN ruin a good thing by placing a bubblegum smacking Michelle Pfeiffer in a musical The only thing I took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it
1	Saving Grace is a feel good movie with its heart in the right place Grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts She could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana Shes living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors Theres only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on its user Its obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff The way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny Its precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by English slapstick and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable

1	Never viewed this film until recently on TCM and found this story concerning Poland and a small town which had to suffer with the Nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other European Cities for example Norway The First World War was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which War always creates Alexander Knox Wilhelm GimmGorky Park returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town He was brought up a German and was not very happy with the Polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either As the Hitler party grew to power Wilhelm Grimm desired to become a Nazi in order to return and punish this small Polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind Marsha HuntMarja PacierkowskiChloes Prayer played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with Whilhelm Gimm There are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the Nazi destroyed peoples families and their entire lives The cattle cars are shown in this picture with Jewish people heading to the Nazi gas chambers If you have not seen this film and like this subject matter give it some of your time this film is very down to earth for a 1944 film and a story you will not forget too quickly
0	The movie started off strong LL Cool J Deed as an undercover police officer with partner Sgt Lazerov Dylan McDermott from the Practice possibly miscast as a bad guy committing robbery and murder Deed refuses to kill the drug dealer which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience The other big names Freeman Spacey et al are well cast and the movie shows promisebr br The movie begins to fall short as soon as Justin Timberlake Pollack is introduced Given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of Timberlake I would choose the former Even talented actors have to work hard at their craft Timberlake is NOT talented and no amount of hard work can save him I would have thought he would put on a better show given the fact that he has been acting talented for years Everything he did in this film was unconvincingbr br Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films Even hardcore NSync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talentbr br That aside there are a few plot holes such as Pollacks sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery This movie had so much promise Thoroughly disappointing
0	MABEL AT THE WHEEL is one of those movies with a behindthescenes story thats more interesting than the movie itself This was Chaplins tenth comedy for Keystone during his year of apprenticeship and his first tworeeler Here he played one of his last outandout villain roles although the featurelength TILLIES PUNCTURED ROMANCE was yet to come and it also marked one of the last times he would work for a director other than himself In fact Chaplins conflicts with director and costar Mabel Normand almost got him fired from the studiobr br Chaplin hadnt gotten along with his earlier directors Henry Lehrman and George Nichols but according to his autobiography having to take direction from a mere girl was the last straw Charlie and Mabel argued bitterly during the making of this film Chaplin was still a newcomer at Keystone and his colleagues didnt know what to make of him but everyone loved Mabel Producer Mack Sennett was on the verge of firing Chaplin when he learned that the newcomers films were catching on and exhibitors wanted more of them ASAP so Chaplin was promised the chance to direct himself in return for finishing this movie the way Mabel wanted itbr br Unfortunately none of that drama is visible on screen in MABEL AT THE WHEEL which looks like typical Keystone chaos The story concerns an auto race in which Mabels beau Harry McCoy is scheduled to compete but wicked Charlie and his henchmen abduct the lad and Mabel must take the wheel in his place For all the racing around brick hurling and fingerbiting the film is frankly short on laughs but there are a few points of interest Theres some good cinematography and editing in the race sequence though there arent really any gags just lots of frantic activity Chaplin himself looks odd sporting a goatlike beard on his chin and wearing the top hat and frock coat he wore in his very first film appearance MAKING A LIVING but the outfit suits the oldfashioned villainy he displays throughout At least its novel to watch him play such an uncharacteristic role Visible in the stands at the race track are such Keystone stalwarts as Chester Conklin Edgar Kennedy in a strangely dandified getup and a more characteristic Mack Sennett spitting tobacco and doing his usual mindless rube routine As a performer Sennett was about as subtle as the movies he produced but you have to give the guy credit he knew what people liked These films were hugely popular in their day Macks performance doesnt add much to MABEL AT THE WHEEL but he probably had to be on hand for the filming of this one to make sure his stars didnt kill each other
0	I watched like 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them had any impact on mebr br I watched several documentaries about him He is obviously an intelligent man with great knowledge about films and passion for making them but does this makes him a good director Definitely NO A complete antitalent He can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits but a film with actors  neverbr br He cant direct nor write His screenplays are full of badly thought out situations and many situationsdialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word art in any sense No way Not to mention the unskillful direction so amateurishlike To say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a liebr br Like the scene when Scheitz gets arrested and Storszek hides in the back of the store WHO IS HE KIDDINGbr br He is a cheater he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want He knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising Never mind the rest of the script and sloppy directionbr br Just look at Julio Medem If Herzog can make a movie like Medem can then I might recheck his old movies and try to find talent in them

0	i should love this movie the acting is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me the movie makes working class people look low and cheap the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy Barbara Stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about itagain the acting was very very good and worth watching i really dont like the story line just a personal preference thank you
0	Beginning with the poster featuring only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey the entire movie was a fraud One stereotype after another this movie was about nothing or nothing new at least After 1015 minutes you realize that youve just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J recite their way through another copflickbr br Basically the story is about the corrupt system in some city all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town under the watchful eye of some hotshot politician The almighty and abovethelaw organization is called FRAT and guess what theyve got a kickass loony cop shooting and beating at will suspects girlfriends you name it FRAT cops are corrupt and greedy so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented journalist One hour later after a series of unbelievably badmade shooting scenes and more stereotype lines everything ends happily and we get served the final line you cant beat the system Bah Dont see this waste of film roll Freeman and Spacey barely have 10 min altogether
0	I saw this last week after picking up the DVD cheap I had wanted to see it for ages finding the plot outline very intriguing So my disappointment was great to say the least I thought the lead actor was very flat This kind of part required a performance like Johny Depps in The Ninth Gate of which this is almost a complete ripoff but I guess TV budgets dont always stretch to this kind of acting abilitybr br I also the thought the direction was confused and dull serving only to remind me that Carpenter hasnt done a decent movie since In the Mouth of Madness As for the story well I was disappointed there as well There was no way it could meet my expectation I guess but I thought the payoff and explanation was poor and the way he finally got the film anticlimactic to say the leastbr br This was written by one of the main contributors to AICN and you can tell he does love his cinema but I would have liked a better result from such a good initial premisebr br I took the DVD back to the store the same day
0	Quite honestly The Omega Code is the worst movie I have seen in a very long time During the first 30 minutes I sat stunned in my seat trying to decide if I should demand a refund But since I hadnt paid to see it in the first place passes I figured I might as well stay And I didnt think it could possibly get any worsebr br It did I will quickly run through the low points includes some spoilers The horrible miscasting of Casper Van Dien as Gillen Lane a motivational speaker with two PhDs The characterization was inconsistent for example Lane despite his credentials is a complete nitwit Then theres the lameo depiction of the fulfillment of the Biblical prophecies we see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated Biblical Code Also terrible action sequences Lane escapes from tough situations without explanation and the one time Lane actually does seem to be in danger it turns out to be a dream sequence Thats cute for grammar school writing assignments but its an inexcusable plot device in a motion picture The pacing was bad after a long opener the first third of the movie changes scenes every 90 seconds Later the pacing improves but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around And as someone else mentioned years pass yet no one not even Lanes young daughter ages That was disconcertingbr br There are a few good things though The quality of the film eg lack of graininess is high and very attractive The outdoor shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism Also there are a few moments in the last part of the film when Lane calls on God finally to help him this proved to be quite exhilarating even to me someone who does not accept Jesus as a personal savior But I liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie Unfortunately it was followed by major incomprehensibilitybr br The characters dialogue direction and acting were ALL poorly done Michael Ironside had nothing to do and Michael York was just weird I think the producers wanted to do too much if the plot had been tighter and more focused and the characterization more fleshed out the film would have been far better br br In a nutshell The Omega Code disappoints Definitely do not pay to see this I give it out of ten starsbr br
1	This movie maked me cry at the end I watch at least 34 movies a week I seen loads of great movies even more crap ones But when ending scene catharsic at its core came I Cried And if you didnt you have serious problems The story is archetypal nothing new or original But its real because that sort of things really happened and that people really exist Glam isnt my sort of music but I really admire all that they went through in early 70s At some point this directed me toward Velvet Goldmine Docudramas never really work very good But this movie really meked us believe it allBecause they dont try to make it as a path full of glorious concerts present musicians that are superheroes groupie girls that are stupid and emotionally numb they dont glorify drugs and alcohol they promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes even 20 years late Once again great movie Since Leaving Las Vegas I was never so moved by a movie
0	This time the hero from the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot combos against super universal soldiers and a computer which has gone awry and is prepared to take over the world Im pretty sure it was Double Team which convinced everyone that JeanClaude Van Damme was no longer credible in providing watchable action flicks However it was this that tarnished his credibility forever While Universal SoldierThe Return isnt as dull as Double Team or The Questits still pretty awful indeed with none of the style and flair of the original and no star pairing This sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling As I look back not even the action sequences were all that exciting and therefore this movie is a worthless dud In other words another clunker in Van Dammes assembly linebr br out of 4Bad

1	I dont understand Not being a critic i am not evaluating the quality of the acting which I find believable a good thing My confusion lies with the content Is no one else sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women were justifying their infidelity to men who were fighting and bleeding to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and their country Should there not have been a prologue informing us if the men made it home and if so what effect their cheating wives infidelity had on them While these women were bedding their paramours out of a sense loneliness did they think that their husbands were enjoying being shot at while facing death or dismemberment daily They didnt think of their husbands at all Only of themselves Pardon me except when they wished their husbands dead
1	The second of the Why We Fight Series concentrates on Hitlers grab of the Sudetanland and beyond as he makes a chump out of Neville Chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of Europe br br Clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series over the test of time has become an informative documentary as well with most of the Allied bias turning out to be historical fact The Fuhrer hoists himself on his own petard with smug pronouncements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves East The Czechs and Austrians quickly capitulate but the Poles put up an heroic struggle against overwhelming odds br br The disparity between Hitlers military might and Chamberlain waving the Munich treaty like a white flag declaring Peace in our time to this day has durable propaganda qualities Here in its original context it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of World War ll sets in on Europe leaving the American viewer with two options freedom or slavery In 1943 there was no evading this simple truth and The Nazis Strike makes its point effectively

0	OK me and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of bmovies since we do them ourselves Anyway the cover contained blood and weird looking naked girls with fangs and stuff and Tom Savini There is just no way this movie can fail Right wrong It just seems like such a waste There was really no story the dialog was terrible is anyone there x 1000 the characters were well they really lacked any kind of personality The effects were terrible and whats up with these long artsy shots of scared people running around doing nothing with extreme closeups of eyes and stuff We were sitting the whole movie waiting for something anything to happen but no oh here comes the nymphs great oh theyre kissing again and now for the violence OK nothing really happens again oh now they run around and the closeups of eyes again oh heres Tom Savini Oh he died right OK maybe now something cool or even interesting will happen no oh Cool a severed head the end oh crap And finally since im so full of myself ill tell you this Give me a van six actors a weird looking house Tom Savini a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood and i could make the coolest movie youve ever seen Ive made movies with zero budget in two days that has better effects better acting and a better script than this what is this Johannes guy doing Making cool movies is easyIt could have been so great Im really upset
1	As with all the other reviewers this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years I recall going to the library researching all that I could on this story I even wrote to the PBS station for more information Despite all this all I was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the 1900sbr br Fastward to 2002 after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was a VHS copy of the movie There was one other bidder but I was determined to win this movie The losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which I gave her Despite owning a copy I still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a DVD copy of the movie You can find it at httpwwwjohntoppingcomHarvey20PerrWar20Widowwarwidowhtml
0	the single worst film ive ever seen in a theater i saw this film at the austin film festival in 2004 and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival it was an interesting premise and seemed like it could go somewhere but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything first of all if youre going to do a musical find someone with musical talent the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming the lyrics were terribly written and when they werent obvious rhymes they were groaninducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work and youd think youd find people who could sing when making a musical right not in this case luckily they were half talkinghalf singing in rhyme most of the time but when they did sing it made me cringe especially when they attempted to sing in harmony and that just addresses the music some of the acting was pretty good but a lot of the dialog was terrible as well as most of the scenes they obviously didnt have enough coverage on the scenes or they just had a bad editor because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again
1	An unusual film from Ringo Lam and one thats strangely underappreciated The mix of fantasy kungfu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes A horseback rider get chopped in two and his waist and legs keep riding the horse Several horses get chopped up Its very unexpectedbr br The story is very simple Fong and his Shaolin brothers are captured by a crazed maniac general and imprisoned in the Red Lotus temple which seems to be more of a torture chamber then a temple The General has a similarity to Kurtz in Apocalypse Now as he spouts warped philosophy and makes frightening paintings with human blood br br The production is very impressive and the setting is bleak Blood is everywhere The action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many HK action scenes from the time Sometimes the movie veers into absurdity or the effects are cheesy but its never bad enough to ruin the film br br Find this one its one of the best HK kung fu films from the early nineties Just remember its not child friendly
1	There has been a political documentary of recent vintage called Why We Fight which tries to examine the infamous Military Industrial Complex and its grip on this nation It is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in Iraq Yet a far more famous series of films with the same name was made during World War Two by Hollywood director Frank Capra Although considered documentaries and having won Oscars in that category this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop more in the vein of Leni Reifenstals Triumph Of The Will scenes of which Capra recycles for his own purposes That said that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of World War Two documentaries such as the BBCs lauded The World At War lacked nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable They are skillfully made and after recently purchasing some used DVDs at a discount store I found myself with the opportunity to select a free DVD with my purchase I chose Goodtimes DVDs four DVD collection of the seriesbr br Rarely has something free been so worth invaluable While there are no extras on the DVDs and the sound quality of the prints varies these films provide insight into the minds of Americans two thirds of a century ago when racism was overt as in many of the classic Warner Brothers prowar cartoons of the era and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts The seven films produced between 1942 and 1945 are Prelude To War The Nazis Strike Divide And Conquer The Battle Of Britain The Battle Of Russia The Battle Of China and War Comes To Americabr br Overall the film series is well worth watching not only for the obvious reasons but for the subtle things it reveals such as the use of the plural for terms like X millions when referring to dollars rather than the modern singular or the most overused graphic in the whole series a Japanese sword piercing the center of Manchuria Yet it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars The lesson of World War One avoid foreign entanglements was not applicable to World War Two whose own lesson act early against dictatorships has not been applicable in the three major wars America has fought since Korea Vietnam nor Iraq The fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in todays informationclogged times It may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today but at least youll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position nor will you be the last
0	I just watched this movie on Starz Let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved the acting writing directing special effects camera crew sound and lighting It also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie Apparently back in 2007 when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for 75 million Nowadays those things cost about 3 billion and they cant go invisible Apparently you can fly from the US to the middle east in an hour There was a completely random lesbian scene which I didnt mind but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it The camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes Oh yeah since its a Steven Segal movie its predictable as hell All in all I rank it right up there with Snakes on a Plane
0	I usually dont comment anything i read the others opinions but this this one I have to comment I was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action F117 and other hitech stuff but by only few first minutes and I changed my mind Lousy acting lousy script and a big science fictionbr br Its one of the worst movies I have ever seenbr br Simply dont botherbr br And one more thing before any movie I usually check user comments and rating on this site 37 points and I give this movie a try now Im wondering WHO rate this movie by giving it more than 2 points
1	Ive read most of the comments here I came to the conclusion that almost everybody agrees that 911 is a shocking piece of history There are a few who think that the added narrative is weak and br br I agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary About two brothers finding each other back after the disaster and the cliff hanger about Tony But I dont think narration is unnecessary Like I lot of theorists I think that our own lives are narrations We are living and making our own autobiography So if we tell about our lives this is always in the form of narration We dont sum up facts like Birth Childhood High School etc We create a story about our livebr br Because we are familiar with stories we want to put history in a story as well Because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves We can better understand the things happened in history when its told in the form of a story So thats the purpose of adding a story in documentary The story is weak so be it but we understand whats going on If it was me out there I would be worried sick about my brotherbr br And the second point making a blockbuster movie about it True its been to recent to come up with a big movie about 911 Though there have been a few about the subject but none of them like this documentary But what if there will be a movie in about 5 years I agree it is wrong trying to make a lot of money out of 911 But I also agree that movies are one of the best way to tell history How many movies about the World war 2 have we seen If I had not seen these movies my view of the WW would me totally different I remember seeing Schindlers List and I cried for an hour during class Movies give you a good image of the things that happened in history and although it is fiction it contributes to the memory of the disasters and the casualties br br So my point telling stories is not always bad it makes us identify with the story and makes us never forget what happened

1	To sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible Every fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapidfire images through to the last shot of the clean up at Ground Zero but every frame is real The story was thought up by two French brothers living in New York Jules 28 and Gideon 31 Naudet pronounced Nauday want to make a documentary on New York City Firefighters beginning with a newbie from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to fullfledged firefighter Seeking the help of their close friend actor James Hanlon 36 an actor and firefighter at Station 1 Engine 7 the Naudets sift through the Probies at the academy and find one Tony Benetakos to focus the bulk of their documentary onbr br Tony becomes the butt of jokes and slowly learns the ins and outs of station life through the members of this closeknit family Firefighters have a superstition about Probies It is that they are either White Clouds or Black Clouds meaning that with the latter all kinds of fires follow the Probie The former means that very little fire activity follows but one day there will be the mother of all fires Tony is a White Cloud After some initial growing pains Tony settles into the firehouse as if he were a seasoned vet Then the unthinkable occursbr br September 11 2001 begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from Wall Street Because Jules has had little camera experience Gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief T K Pfeiffer Arriving at about 842 the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate Then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene and as Jules pans upwards we see the first strike of the day American Airlines Flight 11 smashes into the face of the North Tower of 1 World Trade Pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the World Trade Center Once there Jules asks to accompany the Chief into the tower Pfeiffer tells Naudet to stick close to him Once inside the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives br br Gideon Naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area Once there he captures the impact of the second plane United Airlines Flight 175 with 2 World Trade He knows Jules is with Chief Pfeiffer inside the towers Watching and capturing the crowds reaction to the unimaginable Gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in Lower Manhattan Inside tower one Jules records the last view the world or loved ones will have of their sons fathers uncles grandfathers husbands boyfriends friends as one by one each firefighter carrying 60 lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up 80 stories to rescue the injured and trapped Jules also catches the last glimpse Chief Pfeiffer will have of his brother Kevin as he leaves to do his selfless duty Also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke But Jules is respectful never once does he capture a sensationalistic momentthe money shot His work is professional through his baptism of fire He also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building Then Jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken Father Michael Judd the Chaplain for the fire department Then as Jules and Chief Pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two tower one begins its structural collapse br br What results is a breathtakingly poignant view from inside Ground Zero as Jules and Gideon work separately to document that day Not knowing if either is alive each fearing the worst As each firefighter arrives at the firehouse they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back And in one moment of overwhelming emotion Jules and Gideon are reunited As Jules cries on his brothers shoulder Gideon embraces his younger brother as Hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject There is one fearful moment when Tony Benetakos who left the station with a former chief is believed to have been lostbut returns to the fold this Probie has proven himselfbr br Shown with only three interruptions 911 is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking It ranks up there with the Hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds The Naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject In lesser hands the tendency would be toward the sensational but the Naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion Narrated by Hanlon we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of September 11 Robert De Niro hosts the program in a sombre restrained way He never seeks the camera for his own glory rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see I also commend CBS for their bravery at airing this special Chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished This is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is It isnt about dribbling a basketball or selling an album of hate lyrics911 is about humanity at its best Heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom br br
0	Universal Soldier The Return is not the worst movie ever made No that honor would have to go to a film that attempted to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner However perhaps no movie I have ever seen has tried for so little and succeeded so completely as did Universal Soldier The Return br br This film is a scifiaction travesty that has virtually nothing to recommend it The acting is as bad as any movie Ive ever seen The plot is terrible and predictable The special effects are pathetic In short anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves US The Return makes previous Van Damme fare seem like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces Some movies are so bad theyre good Believe me when I tell you that this is not one of them Im really not sure what else to say here I doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they hadnt already but just in case dont
0	What can I say A Kamal Hassan movie being horrible He acts very well but it is a horrible story along with horrible direction In my kind opinion the director Gautham Menon must give up directing There is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie Apart from that one can just not believe how true were those horrendous crimes There was no practicality in the movie Gautham is just running out of stories But both Kamal Hassan and Jyothika act really well The villains look too ugly though their performance was not bad I do not think this is a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa which you can see with the family You will not get sleep seeing this movie However Harris Jayaraj again did a great job and that is why I have given this movie 4 out of 10 His song Partha Modail Nallae is soulful and soothing Apart from that great cinematography On the whole this is just a bad bad movie Kamal Hassan I think should have rejected this movie
0	I dont remember the last time I reacted to a performance as emotionally as I did to Justin Timberlakes in Edison I got so emotional I wanted to scream in anguish destroy the screen readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism Timberlake is horribly miscast in fact casting him is like casting Andy Dick to play the lead role in Patton or Nathan Lane to play Jesus But that is almost beside the pointbr br Timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role I used to have problems with Ben Afflecks acting talent but Timberlake makes Affleck look like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench With his metrosexual lisp read lithp his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like The 25 Cliché Expressions for Actors he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly and no matter how you slice it I do not and will not buy his role as an amateurturnedcrusaderforjustice journalist It simply will not flybr br However Timberlake alone isnt to blame for his failure Director David J Burke puts him not only in the essentially primary role but also places him aside Morgan Freeman Kevin Spacey John Heard Dylan McDermott Cary Elwes and Im surprised he was as good LL Cool J I can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with Timberlakebr br There is an upside to this of course the moment any of these actors interact without Justin there it feels like a double relief A pleasure if you will Freeman and Spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our socalled hero Dylan McDermott is also a breath of fresh airbr br But enough of Timberlake bashing words arent enough in this particular case to do the trick Edison is a very very runofthemill corruption story Its plot ranges from cliché to simply preposterous I do however admire the motivation behind making it which I interpret as an homage to films like Serpico or Donnie Brasco or maybe even Chinatown Dont get me wrong Edison is not even in the same ballpark as these films but I can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence perhaps to justify my sitting through itbr br The script in and of itself features some surprisingly bad writing Yes it has some decent interchanges but any conversation between Piper Perabo who is wasted here and Timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a Dawsons Creek episode Its your typical fartooglibforreality letsimpresstheaudiencewithhowwellwearticulate and fail dialogue This dialogue mind you is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments sometimes it feels like Edison wants to morph into a music video where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds read slowmotionbr br Thinking about it Edison is a curiosity Its sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by Timberlake who simply doesnt work In film as in most art if one thing is off the whole thing feels off Directors must make tough choices David J Burke missed the mark here Some of the scenes play well in and of themselves but as a whole they dont seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture And its not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with
1	Well was Morgan Freeman any more unusual as God than George Burns This film sure was better than that bore Oh God I was totally engrossed and LMAO all the way through Carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe and Aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance I for one dont consider her to be either ugly or untalented I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history See if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor I was rolling over this one Well written and even better played out this comedy will go down as one of this funnymans best
1	Election is a Chinese mob movie or triads in this case Every two years an election is held to decide on a new leader and at first it seems a toss up between Big D Tony Leung Ka Fai or as I know him The Other Tony Leung and Lok Simon Yam who was Judge in Full Contact Though once Lok wins Big D refuses to accept the choice and goes to whatever lengths he can to secure recognition as the new leader Unlike any other Asian film I watch featuring gangsters this one is not an action movie It has its bloody moments when necessary as in Goodfellas but its basically just a really effective drama There are a lot of characters which is really hard to keep track of but I think that plays into the craziness of it all a bit A 100yearold baton which is the symbol of power I mentioned before changes hands several times before things settle down And though it may appear that the film ends at the 65 or 70minute mark there are still a couple big surprises waiting Simon Yam was my favorite character here and sort of anchors the picturebr br Election was quite the award winner at last years Hong Kong Film Awards winning for best actor Tony Leung best picture best director Johnny To who did Heroic Trio and best screenplay It also had nominations for cinematography editing film score which I loved and three more acting performances including Yam

1	This movie was very funny I couldnt stop smiling when watching this and have already watched it twice in a period of 2 days The movie is distinctively unique in its humor and visuals both are terrific and on par with Natalis other more serious movie gems Cube and Cypher I have become a huge Vincenzo Natali fan ever since watching Cypher and everything hes made is very interestingbr br Very likable about this movie are the music and loser characters Dave and Andrew portrayed by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller cowriter of the story actors I both like very much Also cool are the XBox Dead Or Alive fights you even see Dave playing Halo at a point and Andrews amazing guitar solo among many other thingsbr br All in all a great feelgood film about friendship You have to see this
1	When I think about this movie all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world Texture smell color thats how I think this movie should be judged in terms of See the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace or the sweltering turkish bath and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice coarse cloth smooth skin scented oils flickering flames satin rustle Dont just watch and listen be absorbed let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you
1	I nominate this and BABYLON 5 as the best television scifi series made Both stand out in my mind because unlike early STAR TREK series there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREKTNG they were fine shows but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes In many ways you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 with its giant battles that took up all of the final season and the other TREK shows as there was more of a larger story that unified them This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with SG1 The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form Sure there were a few throwaway episodes that were not connected to the rest but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funnybr br And speaking of funny I loved that SG1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasnt so dreadfully serious In this way I actually enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5 Jack ONeill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of Homer Simpsonits really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasonsbr br To truly appreciate SG1 you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work This coherence gives the show exceptional staying power And if you dont like SG1 after giving it a fair chance then scifi is probably NOT the genre for you
1	I saw this when it first came to video my little sister got it as a gift and I was probably 12 at the time What stood out for me was the lack of midmovie conflict that so many movies have where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just dont say the one thing that youre shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say This is what I like the most about the movie I guess that the main characters dont do mean things to each other halfway through they dont break up and make up they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes onbr br These two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track theyre not that different Loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family and Cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone Anyway I saw this movie posted on Hulu and had to watch it again sure theres plot holes if you analyze the script and no Woog and Dweeb shouldnt be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in realitybr br Now what detracts from the film is its unexpected scariness Little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with Dr Screweyes And the addition of him halfway through the movie though its blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance is too abrupt there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie perhaps to show that its not that scary without the the dinosaurs I guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second halfbr br Considering the target audience who Im sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues I think Ill give it a pass on those factors too and just enjoy the story Its a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years I think
0	Enough is enoughsometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead The first Tremors movie was great The second one was ridiculous The third one was nauseating The tv series was depressingly awful And this movie just drives the stake deeperbr br Basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry now we have the series set in the Wild West in the 1800s and they fight graboids Like a rehash of the first one they have to learn how to beat them all over again Mildly entertaining I suppose Otherwise this straighttovideo release just like Tremors 2 and 3 is just going way too far Oh and I continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking placedid they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event I think something like this would be historymaking so our pals in the first film wouldnt be so unprepared br br Movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy Avoid this garbage

1	Almost 30 years later I recall this original PBS film as almost unbearably tender Periodically I check here at IMDb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a DVD Its September of 2004 and I keep hoping deep sighbr br One of the two lead actors went on to a small career primarily in a primetime evening soap the other Frances Lee McCain was seen in small roles here and there for a few years But nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced as I recall it on a shortlived PBS series which showcased original screenplays by new and upandcoming playwrightsbr br I watched it every time it was shown on PBS maybe 2 or 3 times That was before the era of VCRs so I have no record of it except in my minds eyebr br 12312006 addition to above Happy New Year ladies This wonderful film is finally available on DVD at ladyslipperorg My understanding is that the DVDs are burned from the writers own personal copy
0	Except for acknowledging some nice cinematography I can hardly say anything positive about this movie The single real issue is the protagonists dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life Abundant emotionally powerful scenes do not go with this plot and because of bad acting they also fail to create the intended atmosphere The director only manages to introduce Anthonys dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution The characters do not seem to evolve although it is difficult to speak of any characters perhaps except for Sonny Beside him actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to they come off as selfindulging amateurs I wonder what ruined the movie more the superficial script throwing away all the potential of the plot or the bad acting disturbing any appeal that might be left

1	Loved the movie I even liked most of the actors in it But for me Ms Davis very poor attempt at an accent and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch Seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as Ms Davis they would be laughed off the screenbr br I really think she phoned this one in Now if it had Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman playing the part of the wife I would have enjoyed it much morebr br I guess I just dont get Bette Davis Ive always thought of her as an actor that plays herself no matter what role shes in The possible exception is Now Voyagerbr br Im sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful and I hope civil detail how I am totally wrong on this But Ill continue to watch the movies shes in because I like the storieswritingsupporting casts but Ill always be thinking of different actresses that could have done a better job
1	Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation Richard Linklaters romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people The film depicts romance in all its glory but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship thats as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to with just one problem the problem of time While most relationships wind down with time this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out Before Sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental Hollywood romance which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders The story follows two people Jesse an American and Celine a French girl that meet on a train into Vienna They instantly connect and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train Jesse asks Celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of Viennabr br Before Sunrise works principally for two reasons realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life This allows the characters to be free and its easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script This also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are and not merely because theyre the protagonists This kind of realism is hard to capture as at the end of the day we as the audience know that theyre watching a film and not observing real life but Before Sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen A truly great script cannot work on its own and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice and although Im not a fan of either Julie Deply or Ethan Hawke on viewing this film there is nothing you can do but give them both respect I dont know whether they were in character or just playing themselves but when a film is this good it hardly mattersbr br In a film like this it is the writing thats the most important thing and contained within the script are several observations about life most of which I personally could relate to This represents what Richard Linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters but it also manages to expose what true love is along with several other aspects of life The fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing Everyone is different and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people There could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates and thats the case with the musings in this script Adding to the beauty of the film is the city of Vienna The city itself isnt really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the locationbr br Before Sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating Richard Linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental Before Sunrise is what it is And what it is is pure cinematic brilliance

0	If you are a fan of really bad movies and you think there funny you will the great acting of Shaq First off putting pro players in movies hardly ever works Shaq had to of been the worst actor i have ever seen next to Dennis Rodman who also made a few bad movies Well any way this movie is also bad due to the hideous kid I would give this a zero but that is impossible
1	Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released Ben Affleck is funny as an obnoxious millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family for Christmas He then drives the family crazy with overindulgence for Christmas cheer I have not been a Ben Affleck fan in the past though I did like Daredevil and Paycheck but here he is well cast in this role I also like Christina Applegate as the daughter in the family who cant stand Afflecks character at first Sure you can see where this movie is going but you dont care Ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of Christmas movies

1	Lets cut a long story short I loved every minute of it A lavish fantasy in true ArabianNights style Theres an evil magician a pretty princess a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after Modern Hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic Only quibble the special effects are pretty dated loved Sabu with the djinns foot though
1	I love this movie I mean the story may not be the best but the dancing most certainly makes up for it You get to know a little bit about each character the way THEY want you to learn about them I just think that you wont like this movie unless youre into Broadway
1	This is a comedy based on national stereotypes no doubt If you leave away pretending you know or you care what Communism was about and how real Russians or Brits are if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions you can have fun with this film Nicole Kidman is at her best sexy moving and funny Ben Chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely outshadowed by Nicole and the rest of the cast does good work as well The final is moving and logical movie logics of course Worth watching if you accept the rules of the game
0	In the first one it was mainly giant rats but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too This one however is just giant rats period well giant rats and one really growing little boy This one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer ratsyou know how it is This movie has some kills and its moments but I find it to be on par with the original I just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies Well that is not trueI actually like Empire of the Ants maybe I just do not care for giant rodents All in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre I just cant recommend this one
0	I rented End Game having never heard of it but Im fond of political thrillers so I thought Id give it a shot After doing some research on the movie I found that it had initially been intended for theatrical release but instead had gone strait to DVD After seeing it Im thinking no wonder The movie is shocking in its unoriginality The plot and the characters are perfunctory I figured out whodunnit by the half way mark but the ending was a curve ball I have to say I didnt expect it to end quite the way it did but thats not a point in its favor The more predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad Perhaps the film makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twisteven one that made the movie even worsebr br Stay away I want the 598 and my 107 minutes back
1	We so often talk of cinema landmarks Kane The Godfather A Bout de Souffle One film however is too often overlooked by serious film critics I am talking of course about the classic Doc Savage MoBbr br This film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by US imperialism Not to mention kungfubr br It also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history until of course Queens breathtaking work on Flash Gordon Although a bit of a rarity this film is well worth seeking out it will repay the effort of your search tenfold
1	So what constitutes a real independent film In a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear rugged and cutting edge Im sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing ploybr br Which is why we should be glad that films like Hatred of a Minute exist Across the board this film makes a point out of contradicting its own template indie horror film Love it or hate it Hatred isnt afraid of being what it is and in watching this film you get the real sense that Kallio the director didnt just make this film to spray fake blood all over the place hes in this to tell stories Good ones You may find this film in the horror film section of your video store but dont be fooled this story is also about love about good people pushed over the edge and that ohsodistant light at the end of the tunnelbr br If you expect smut or an Evil Dead ripoff stay away from this film But if you dig the finer points of the horrorsuspense genres check this film outbr br Yes Bruce Campbell did produce this movie and Im sure hes proud to tell anyone that its not Evil Dead Bruce has never tried to bank on his ash image and its obvious that he didnt get involved with Hatred so that it could do so eitherbr br My advice though to all Deadites rabidly devouring anything issued by Mr Campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else Mr Kallio and Mr Campbell are trying to show youbr br The acting is well done although nothing about this film is oscar caliber perhaps intentionally its good to see compassionate performances in a horror film So often actors in films such as these dont even seem to try with Hatred it seemed as though all the actors took thier charecters very seriously never resorting to typical horrorfilm campinessbr br Technically Hatred is about as competent as indie film gets The editing is fast paced the cinematography is good given the budget and Hatred keeps a quick pace without any bogdown points or bad anticlimaxesbr br All in all Hatred may not have the glossed over look of all those multimillion dollar fake indies but personally I dont see a problem with that Its a film by folks who actually care about the medium People who reached into thier broke ass pockets pulled out thier nickles and dimes threw caution to the wind and made a damn good moviebr br Check this one out

0	Or Marlowe At Sea Yet another ridiculously overrated old film with Bogey Quite talky too Bogey basically plays the same character as in the Marlow films always in control of a situation never nervous no matter how dangerous a situation calls women slim and dames and other such nonsense is the only real male ie alpha male in the movie the only other alpha male male being the head of Gestapo but he is only a fat alpha male male and naturally every attractive young woman who comes his way cannot resist his charms and wants his penis within hours of their initial introduction The character clichés are all here Bogey is supposed to be the same type of cynicabouttoreform as in Casablanca and naturally he often refuses money or other valuables when being offered them but how does that fit in with the tough cynic in him It doesnt so he cant be a cynic Hawks wanted it both ways a character who is both the cool lone cynic and yet a wellmeaning humanitarian I dont think so Bacall does her nonchalant cool babe routine for the first time and there are plenty of overrated not alltoo interesting socalled sexual innuendo exchanges between her and Bogey these dialogues sound silly by todays standards Just purse your lips and whistle A load of crap She was 19 when this was made but looks a lot older and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day Her bony face with its sharp features is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de Havilland the cuteness of a Myrna Loy let alone the likability of an Irene Dunne Bacall was more suited for playing vampires not femmefatales In real life she is very much like her face a Hollywood bitch There is a scene in which Bacall breaks into tears very unsuitable for her character There are two or three bad musical numbers but my fastforward button was readybr br If youre interested in reading my biographies of Bogart Bacall Huston and other Hollywood personalities contact me by email

0	Time spent watching this film was time wasted I do not dislike science fiction I do not reject any genre per se since good work can be done in any genre This film however is not good work I cannot fault the visuals when not involving alien makeups and the special effects are impressive The story was not outandout BAD for a trekkish comic book But the fx visuals were obviously where all the makers interestattentionmoney went The direction alternated between sluggish and confusing one was not at all sure exactly who was doing what and with what and to whom at at least one crucial juncture The acting was mostly very bad indeed There was no basis to most of the line readings besides a hint of It was that way on the page and the director told me I was supposed to be madsadscaredwhatever Okay so it was a SF series pilot Since when is that an excuse for correctable shoddiness in areas when should be regarded as essential to a dramatic medium Im astonished the pilot sold the series Or is the money also in the hands of technerds
1	One of the first OVAs original video animation I ever bought this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles A cyberpunk scifi action comedy set against an unlikely for a comedy that is background of nearfuture pollution in a dystopian societybr br The heroes of Dominion are the Tank Police formed with a if we cant beat crime well get bigger guns philosophy and who are like the name suggests patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch Most if not all of these cops are borderline psychopaths and neurotics giving new meaning to the phrase loose cannonsbr br Equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries terrorist Buaku and his henchwomen the Twin Cat Sisters whose existence always seems to involve giving the Tank Police a hard timebr br The animation is not state of the art but its very nice otherwise the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of Dominionbr br The English dubbing is again lots of fun The soundtrack of the English version is also very good I wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of thatbr br Anyway Dominion Tank Police is great Its Japanese cyberpunk SF with lots of comedy filled with completely overthetop characters and situations making sure that it never takes itself seriously Highly recommended
0	i was given the book version of Kazaam for my 8th birthday and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie but this time they were wrong At least with the movie its over soonbr br The acting in this is terrible which i expected from a film with Shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there The kid in the film that plays Max is whiny and a terrible actor Hes bullied by neighborhood kids which i dont blame them because hes a little douche bagbr br The story is just plain stupid and extremely cliché About a boy whos father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his fatherbr br Even at 8 years old i thought this was a stupid idea Its a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because its an embarrassment and should have never been made i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks but you should already know just by reading the plot
1	Amazing movie that in theory should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that I have long despaired of ever finding Instead of relying on clichés and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments The lead characters are not perfect and so relating to them as people you could know is easy The movie is not trying to pull laughs or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance br br I am now restless waiting for the weekend so I can see the sequel A moving thought provoking funny look at love that I think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with Casablanca and Breakfast at Tiffanys Will soften even the hardiest heart
1	So I rented Still Crazy instead When I described Hardcore Logo to the guy at the video store he said that sounded kind of like Still Crazy So I rented it Was I disappointed Well yes as Still Crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band but thats OK Still Crazy tells the story of the Strange Fruit a rock band that broke up in the 70s at the peak of their popularity at a large rock festival Twenty years later the band members are all struggling to make a living and are offered the opportunity to play a concert at the twenty year anniversary of this festival They take up the offer and decide to reform on a permanent basis touring Europe in the process Some quite funny hijinks ensue and all the characters go through subtle changes Watching this movie you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited documentary than a participant And thats not bad at all
0	Id like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest crappiest movie Ive ever seenbr br I have no idea whats wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings the only thing I can imagine is that people mustve voted during one or more conditionsbr br 1 While being shitfaced stoned out of their minds 2 Theyve received hard cash for the votes 3 Under gunpointbr br I cant believe I wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie

0	Once again Canadian TV outdoes itself and creates another show that will go unwatched after its premiere episode br br Last time I remember sitcoms were supposed to induce a reaction we in the business call laughter How funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people thinking that all Muslims are terrorists OK maybe one joke just to stick it to the masses But not 30 minutes Its called beating a dead horse Even SNL would know to give up after a commercial breakbr br Also lets have a little conflict in these scripts Will she or wont she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast on Ramadan When will Ramadan start Ohhhhh this is Emmy winning stuff here br br And the characters What characters They are all cardboard cutouts without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to the next Thats the point of the situation comedy We need to have strong interesting dynamic characters so that we are constantly drawn to the TV set each week We have to care about these characters to worry about what trouble theyre going to get into next week If I never see these characters itll be too soon Thankfully I cant remember any of their names note to CBC thats not a good signbr br And the acting is so bland Its more so a problem in casting than in the actors None of these people actually embody the characters they play They just seem to act their part as though they were working on a movie of the week Sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character make us fall in love with them where they become inseparable from the character the portray Watch any American sitcom and youll see how easily identifiable characters are Part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as though it might be a platform to bigger and better things instead of being their one big character of a lifetime for whom they will spend the next 8 years portraying That level of disinterest in the characters and the project shows But to be honest considering the lame concept and the horrible writing theres not much for the actors to do but say their lines and try not to bump into any furniture As another commenter mentions this seems like a TV movie and not a sitcombr br And the directing or lack there of What can I say Canada has so much talent look at what the Comedy Channel is doing with Puppets Who Kill and Punched Up Look at the Trailer Park Boys not the movie cause it bit the big helium dog Look at any American show to see the potentials our talent as thats where many of our stars go to find decent workbr br Give credit to the CBC they really know how to build publicity for a nonevent Remember The One No well dont even try to learn any characters names in this show as its sure to go the way of the dodobr br Lets all hope for a full blown ACTRA strike so that nothing like this emerges from the Ceeb for a good long while
0	This was a disappointing film for me It came to me via a boxed set entitled Classic Film Noir which was a gift from someone who knows I typically enjoy films done in that style I insist that noir is a style not a genre I do not think it is a noir film at all There seems to be a tendency these days to label and market every black and white B movie made from 1947 to 1955 as noir and the label does not always fit There is a persecuted male protagonist Ed Cullen Lee J Cobb and most of the films action takes place indoors Those are just about the only noir elements that I could see There is no pervasive paranoia or any real reason why one should sympathize with Ed Cullen Jane Wyatt was overdressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale I do not want to spoil this film for potential viewers However I would be interested in hearing what other connoisseurs of film noir have to say about it

1	Whats with all the negative comments After having seen this film for the first time tonight I can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely persons day When I saw that Drew Ben Affleck might end up spending the holidays alone I wanted to cry Youll have to see the movie if you want to know why Also even though I liked Tom James Gandolfini and Alicia Christina Applegate after awhile if you ask me they were real snobs However this film did make me smile and feel good inside Before I wrap this up Id like to say that Mike Mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit Now in conclusion I highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely persons day to any Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate fan who hasnt seen it
0	No wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie Its just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch Bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic showroom cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a Disneyland attraction Students fistfight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue The Watts riots with a cast ofugh10 Dermot Mulroney tries not to gag while he makes out with a Mary Hartman lookalike with the most annoying smile since Mr Sardonicus Noah Wyle reads Bob Dylan lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and very bad face lift Drunken virgin Rick Schroder sits in a kiddie rocket on his last night before entering the service Silly giggling school girls dress up in leopard stretch pants and walk on the set of Shindig sing horribly off key and actually make it big in the music business And who wrote this compelling dialog Im going to Burkley and wear flowers in my hairI think I found someone to buy Sticks woodyThese people are animals These people are my family as the Shirelles sing Mama Said Oh brother What a mess This is like a Reefer Madness of the 60s except its not even funny
1	Another example of the unique talents of Cary Grant A performance worthy of Oscar consideration yet once again shunned by the Academy Mr Grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city The pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis loosely for the more modern Tom Hanks vehicle The Money Pitbr br If you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex this movie is a must see
0	Welltremors I the original started off in 1990 and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch however they proceeded to make tremors II and III Trust me those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one i mean ass blasters Now only God himself is capable of answering the question why in Gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie Tremors IV cannot be considered a bad movie in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie for it lives up to more than that As i attempted to sit though it i noticed that my eyes started to bleed and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the TV and kill me did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they were from the wild west would make the movie with the exact same occurrences any better honestly i would never suggest buying this movie i mean there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well
1	How anyone can say this is bad is beyond me I loved this show before I even saw it For 3 reasons 1 The Story intrigued me 2 Jessica Alba and 3 James Cameron Please ignore the bad comments and Please watch the whole first Season before you decide that its bad because I know that if you watch the first Season you will LOVE it and go out and Buy Season 1 as well as Season 2 on DVD and then Join the campaign to get Season 3 Madebr br I Hate Fox and Im sure a lot of you Dark Angel fans hate them too They have a thing for Canning Good Shows Dont you all agree
0	This movie is BAD Its basically an overdone copy of Michael Jacksons Thriller video only worse The special effects consist of lots of glow in the dark paint freaky slapstick fastmoving camera shots and lots of growling I think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie
0	Big hair big boobs bad music and a giant safety pinthese are the words to best describe this terrible movie I love cheesy horror movies and ive seen hundredsbut this had got to be on of the worst ever made The plot is paper thin and ridiculous the acting is an abomination the script is completely laughablethe best is the end showdown with the cop and how he worked out who the killer isits just so damn terribly written the clothes are sickening and funny in equal measures the hair is big lots of boobs bounce men wear those cut teeshirts that show off their stomachssickening that men actually wore them and the music is just synthesiser trash that plays over and over againin almost every scene there is trashy music boobs and paramedics taking away bodiesand the gym still doesnt close for bereavement All joking aside this is a truly bad film whose only charm is to look back on the disaster that was the 80s and have a good old laugh at how bad everything was back then
0	The action in this movie beats Sunny bhai in Gadar Akshay Kumar possess the superpowers of Leonidus in 300 Neo in Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman It is hilarious Except for the typical Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comedy I cannot see anything positive in this film The story looks like the writer told his 10yr old son to write The movie is so unreal that Anil Kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director Except for the directors Tashan to make this movie there is no other Tashan I regret wasting my money on this movie and I would not recommend it to anybody 110 is the least I can give on IMDb or I would give it a zero
1	The pilot is extremely well done It lays out how the characters bond in future episodes I dont think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show It displays remarkable creativity on the writers part Although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot An example would be Ross and Rachels future relationship Even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choicebr br Bravobr br A great start to an unbeatable comedy

0	Heres an indie film I really wanted to like but ultimately could not The lack of script boldly proclaimed in the main titles really shows through and kills the picture The story is a nonsensical mess that isnt worth trying to figure out I quickly became bored within 10 minutes then suffered through the remainder of the first 40 minuteshoping for the bestbefore hitting the chapter stops to mercifully get to the end even that wasnt worth the extra effort OZARK SAVAGE clearly tries too hard to be clever lifting its best sequences from EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX As a result theres very little in OZARK SAVAGE that hasnt been done before and better This film would have been much more fun as a 1020 minute short but as a feature it just feels padded and forced Of course theres no money in shorts so I completely understand the financial reasons that I assume motivated it being stretched out to 75 minutes Director Matt Steinauer shows great promise and I wish him luck

0	This movie was the worst movie I have seen since Date Movie I was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared It was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example the eye the tongue the butt the breast If we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite For each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person I believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior I cant believe I wasted my money on this movieSo I dont recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it

1	I also saw this upon its release in 56 and have been struck since then with its final scene If this is an answer to High Noon then its an apt and apposite response The notion that as this string is headed The town comes together is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of High Noon In this theme Concho is a phenomenal precursor of one my other alltime favorites The Magnificent Seven Both Sinatra and Conrad give impressive and convincing performances especially Sinatras transformation from bullying kid brother to liberating town savior I can only hope that at some point all the friends and family on whom over the years Ive inflicted my affection for this movie will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves

0	First of all I am a huge fan of Madeleine LEngle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books A Wrinkle in Time This movie however ruined that excitement for me I am sorry but Meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool In the movie she has straight hair and no glasses and is the sporty type with a deep voice This is not how Madeleine LEngle pictured Meg to be at all In fact Meg was based on Madeleines character and depicted the way she felt when she was young This is just one major example how the book and movie are different So I would say if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes watch it but if you are a devoted fan of Madeleine LEngle and her Wrinkle in Time series I would suggest skipping this movie
1	br br Burning Paradise is a combination of neoShaw Brothers action and Ringo Lams urban cynicism When one watches the film they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesnt matter its attitude and atmosphere that counts This great film has both Always trying to be different than his contemporaries Lam gives us to traditional heroesFong SaiYuk and Hung ShiKwanand puts them in a Raiders of the Lost Ark setting However these are not the lighthearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a Jet Li movie Instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results What makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime there is no holding back Too bad they dont make films like this more often
0	There are many good things about the new BSG Theres the multiple Cylon roles for Model 8 and 6 for example which the two actresses played superbly Theres the old school feel of industrial design aboard Galactica My ship will not be networked over my dead body Also all the space battles the special effects even though the seasoned scifi watcher will acknowledge the cartoonishness of it all The darkness of the characters their essentially flawed naturebr br That makes it all the more bitter that the ending was so childishbr br Yes the first part the scenes in space the raid on the Cylons and all that was very good But the mushy ending I always watch films and shows these days with the timer hidden so I never know how much time is left until the end So for me it was a special kind of torture to see the end happen over and over again Every time I thought oh this is the final scene the final shot I got one more Every frakking character got its complete ending That wasnt really necessarybr br What really highlighted the schoolboy amateurishness of it all The young Roslin scenes Why is important for us to know that a she lost her sisters and father in a horrible accident and b that she has a one night stand with a former pupilstudent What does that bring to the story Where was the linkage Now Im all for a more Europeanish style approach and a random acts of whateverness in films and shows and all that but this was just ridiculous This didnt bring anything meaningful to the storybr br Also Ive seen the Last Frakkin special and in it Ron revealed his own cluelessness about the plot he couldnt come up with a good ending for the story so he just didnt Its never as much about the characters as they made the last episode to be The whole this was thousands of years in the past idea the mitochondrial Eve thing was also used in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and believe you me there are a lot of BSG watchers who know that particular H2G2 storyline And speaking of Hera now theres a storyline that WAS NOT worked out well AT ALL Instead we get Roslin is doing her former pupil whos 20 years younger Dont get me wrong Im all for older women with younger men The more power to them But this just made no sensebr br All in all the writing in this series is as flawed as they intended its characters would be That goes even moreso for the last episode I hope Lost and 24 do better with their series finales

0	This movie had the potential to be really good considering some of the plot elements are borrowed from the scifi actioner THE HIDDEN And Dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles But someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this onebr br Dolph plays a buttkicking monk who travels to New York to retrieve a key that unlocks a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for 2000 years He must battle the minion who is a spirit that jumps from body to body much like THE HIDDEN and JASON GOES TO HELL The minion naturally wants the key so it can let the antichrist out Along for the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and Dolph are chased by the minionpossessed bodiesbr br If Im making this sound entertaining forget it The pacing is very awkward and sluggish the acting subpar at best and the fight scenes staged poorly Dolph sleepwalks through his role and spouts some of the worst dialogue of his careerbr br The cheese factor really picks up at the end when the minion battles an army of machinegun wielding monks at the monastery but the rest of this flick is a snoozefestbr br Too bad I really wanted to like this
0	Unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 except for the R rating there are very few things to like here One or two lines from Kenan Thompson David Koechner we really should see him more and Sam Jackson are humorous and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings but sadly thats it Poor plot Poor acting Worse writing and delivery The special effects are dismal As much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible If we consider the action portions well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan This movie only contains the latter kind This leaves little left Im so glad I did not pay for thisbr br Despite any hype I can read and think so as I sat down to watch I did not expect anything good I had no expectations but was somewhat worried going in Yet like a train wreck one cannot merely look away And even with no expectations I was let down Bad Not even so bad its good material Im very tolerant of bad movies but this makes Six String Samurai which I liked Oscar worthybr br No this piece of over CGId rubbish is in the same company as Battlefield Earth Little Man and Gigli How this is currently rated a 72 completely mystifies me Brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that I can think of as answersbr br I could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight I witnessed a train wreck I need to go wash my eyes 1 of 10
1	I have no idea how a Texan the director Douglas McGrath and the American actress Gwyneth Paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about Ms Paltrow was in the first place I had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her Oscarwinning Shakespeare In Love performance but she gets all the beats right hereshe is nigh on perfect as Emma Woodhouse She may have won her Oscar for Shakespeare but she should be remembered for thisbr br Of course shes surrounded by a great supporting cast including Toni Collette Greta Scacchi Juliette Stevenson et alJeremy Northam is very appealing as the love interest even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to Paltrow in the process allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship several years on Ewans hair is a little easier to take than it was in 96 and personally I find puckish Alan Cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays But the standout is without a doubt Sophie Thompson sister of Emma Thompson daughter of Phyllida Law as Miss Bates what this version needs is a scene where Emma reconciles with Miss Bates as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn The film is worth watching again even for her performance alonebr br All in all this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the British class system Well worth a rental because its unlikely that Paltrow will ever be this good againbut well always have Emma
1	I bought the DVD of Before Sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago Having saw it twice I couldnt help but missing Before Sunrise not because the sequel was not as great but I felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did every time I finished watching one of them I feel the need and yearning to see the other So I ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly I will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly The most remarkable thing about Before Sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other It sounds so simple the growing of the chemistry I think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development but to me who doesnt believe in Nora Ephron Before Sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it When I saw it for the first time about 8 year ago when I was 20 I already liked it But I didnt rate it as a great film it still seemed to me like another thinking persons feel good movie Linklater was too smart to make it more realistic it was 10 minutes too long the characters was too well fabricated I thought I liked it because it was like a dream and because I enjoyed their conversations etc etc But now thanks to Before Sunset I feel thats more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before I saw the elements more clearly Jesse Celine Vienna their conversations everything How each of them are separated element by itself and they have a chance to mix the story is just a frame of time I am no longer feel manipulated And the freedom that every scene has as well as its refusal to be overly efficient how blind I was that those qualities didnt strike me as exceptional when I first saw it Now 8 year have passed the more movies Ive seen the more I realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending even movies like Pulp Fiction or Linklaterss own Slackers included The Jesse and Celine tale avoid that maybe Before Sunset is a better example in this case but Before Sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time not a destination every single scene has its own life I dont know whether Linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made Before Sunrise but to me one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other Before Sunrise which I think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding Jesse and Celine the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it Meanwhile I enter the vision of boredom as Jesse stuck talking to the journalists in Before Sunset and Celines first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile Ive seen in a beginning of a film and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place I dont know with a sadness in me no matter how beautiful Paris is and no matter how happy I am that they meet again Im sorry that I go on this long with my limited English Before Sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it
1	Even though this movie came out a year before I was born it is definetely one of my favorite comedies It stars Redd Foxx as a father who tries to understand his sons homosexuality Like most parents he doesnt know a thing about what it means to be gay and has all of these stereotypical notions of what gay people are like His son Norman is now grown up and living on his own When his father Ben finds out that his son is gay he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him The title comes from one of the funniest lines in the moviewhen Ben gets to Normans apartments he runs into a female prostitute and thinks its his son in drag Norman Is that you The movie had me laughing from start to finish Redd Foxx is great Although a lot of the content is stereotypical I didnt find anything offensive about the way the material was handled and it even has a good ending Highly recommended
1	Im not entirely sure Rob Schmidt qualifies as a Master in the genre of horror since he previously just directed one horror film called Wrong Turn and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre but fact is that he made with Right to Die one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the Masters of Horror franchise There was a similar underdog story in season one when William Malone made on of the best episodes with The Fair Haired Child even though his other long feature films Fear Dot Com and House on Haunted Hill sucked pretty badlybr br The story of Right to Die cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia but thankfully also features multiple oldfashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance murderous conspiracies pitch black humor and comic book styled violence Whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husbands continuous adultery the Addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident Cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife Abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially Whilst Cliff and his sleazy attorney Corbin Bernsen of The Dentist want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor Abbeys mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on Cliff Meanwhile Abbeys hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in Cliffs surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices After a few victims Cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well Right to Die is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff I always hoped to see from a TVseries concept like Masters of Horror Its violent and gory with a sick twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences The euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons The atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling Actresses Julia Anderson and Robin Sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks which is always a welcome plus and Corbin Bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a meanspirited and egocentric bastard Great MoH episode definitely one of the highlights of both seasons
0	This can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you dont take it seriously It is a bit dated and the effects are lame but it is so enjoyable There are giant crabs that attack a girl oh and the crabs sing Japanese It is amazingly bad And the ending which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome Predictable but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat Dont even give this film a chance and you will love it Susan George is fun to watch and yes she does appear naked Her daughter isnt quite worth putting up with but she does get attacked by giant crabs They are the size of large cats This is a 2 but I love it As a movie my God but for entertainment I give it a 7 Did I mention there are giant crabs
0	Lorenzo Lamas stars as some type of CIA agent who captures some exotic beauty named Alexa kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers OJ Simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble I must admit im not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas or his movies He stinks However when compared to OJ Simpson and Lamas comatose wife Kinmont Lamas seems like ah JeanClaude Van Damme I only saw CIA because of the renewed interest around the OJ Simpson trial you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels you couldnt escape this movie in 1994 you could go to an Amish community and some moron would have this playing in their portable TV The movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of OJ Simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor Also where was Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make this a complete camp classic br br out of 4Bad
0	At first the movie seemed to be doing great they had the characters profiles setthe plot seemed to be going in the right direction however as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of thingsor just a lot was edited from the movie The characters identities changed for the worse within the movie Also there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning in other words they had things within the movie that didnt seem to fit the movie itself AND the title no where in the movie does the title fit the movieI suppose the title works for the previews Actors did well with what they hadif they had a better director and writer maybe this would have worked out better But it didnt So now theres a new terrible movie coming out this Friday My opiniondont waste your time or money
1	This is not a bad movie It follows the new conventions of modern horror that is the movie within a movie the well known actress running for her life in the first scene This movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose and manage to do something new and interesting with it It is also always nice to see Molly Ringwald back for the attackbr br So this might be an example of what the genre has become Cut hits all the marks and is actually scary in some parts I liked it I gave it an eight
0	Boring predictable bythenumbers horror outing at least has pretty good special effects and plenty of mindless mayhem and gore to satisfy mindless genre fans Mostly its about giant rats chomping on a set of characters we dont care an iota about if thats your thing tune in 12
0	After watching a dozen episodes I decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is mathematical modeling In the episodes that Charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models I thought that my profession was being joked about I am not a mathematician instead a chemical engineer but I do work a lot with mathematical models So I will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to makebelieve of fairy talesbr br First choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task Charlie Eppes is shown as a genius but even him would have to spend considerable time researching for a suitable model specifically for trying to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future Individuals are erratic and haphazard there is no modeling for them Isaac Asimov even wrote about that in the 1950s Even if there were a model for specific kind of individual it would be a probabilistic stoichastic one meaning it has good chance of making a wrong predictionbr br Second supposing the right model for someone or a situation is found the model parameters have to be known These parameters are the constants of the equations such as the gravity acceleration 98 ms2 and often are not easy to determine Again Charlie Eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses And after the model and the parameters are chosen they would have to be tested Oddly they are not and by miracle they fit exactly the situation that is being predictedbr br Third a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected not only by Numbers but also by scifi movies the computational effort required for solving these models Try to make Excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a Herculean job Even if Charlie Eppes has the right software to solve his models he might be stuck with hardware that will be dreadfully slow And even with the right softwarehardware combination the model solution might well take days to be reached He solves them immediately I could use his computer in my research work I would be very gladbr br As a drama it is far from being the best show The characters are somewhat stereotyped but not even remotely funny as those in Big Bang Theory are The crimes are dull and the way Charlie Eppes solves them sometimes make the FBI look pretty incompetentbr br For some layman the show might work For others the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow
1	Hello Dave Burning Paradise is a film for anyone who likes Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones The films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers As for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes Where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional Hong Kong movie style with the Hollywood action adventure Sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in Hollywood
1	The wit and pace and three show stopping Busby Berkley numbers put this ahead of the overrated 42nd Street This is the definitive 30s musical with a knockout frenetic performance from Jimmy Cagney One of the last releases before the Motion Picture Production Code was strictly enforced A must see
1	As an aging rocker this movie mentions Heep and Quo my 2 favourite bands ever but with the incredible cast everyone and the fantastic storyline I just love this piece of creative genius I cannot recommend it more highly and Mick Jones added so much Foreigner lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer ever Lou Gramm I have watched this great work more than 10 times Bill Nighy what a voice and Jimmy Nail talent oozes from every pore then Astrid and Karen what more could an aging rocker ask for 1010 bloody brilliantbr br Alastair Perth Western Oz Originally from Windsor England
1	This is a decent little flick made in Michigan about a guy that is haunted by his past with his abusive stepfather Gunnar Hansen and has grown up notsowelladjusted In fact hes absolutely bonkers but tries not to be too obvious Hes got an entourage too his own little demon angel that follow him around The demon never says a word but really doesnt have to and hes Max Schreckcreepy Lets just say that the angel pretty much spins his wheels in this as Eric is busy doing things that make him feel better like freeing people that he decides need it mostly beautiful young women This is a decent portrayal of madness and youre kind of on your own at some point to figure out some of whats going on but overall I watched this from start to finish very focused on the film because it definitely held my interest Its a little lacking in some areas but nothing I can really lay my finger on A decent effort and worth seeing IF you like serial killer flicks
1	Titanic is a classic I was really surprised that this movie didnt have a solid ten overall in the IMDb user rankings Maybe its just cool to not give Titanic credit nowadays but when it was first made it was really something When the movie came out people flocked to the theaters When it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month It was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd Many people died on that ship and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that James Cameron stepped up to And lets not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose Whether or not their relationship was a figment of someones imagination it was lovely They barely knew each other but they would die for each other They trusted each other They sure as hell are giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money Ill never let go Jack Titanic is a great film down to its very core It is a powerful story told through brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers It really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie

0	Many people thought that this is a good movie but I dont agree with them At the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the earth but for no reason Also it is in a dark forest I cant see anything on the screen I can only hardly hear the soundbr br After a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that he should not know what happened on the earth so there is a contradiction Finally the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason He was not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here Lastly the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes long the summary is too short and it cant tell the reviewers about the story clearlybr br In conclusion I dont think this is a good movie
0	This movie barely followed the story line of the movie All of the fascinating points in the book didnt even exist in the movie They ended up turning it into a cheesy tween Disney movie crush story between Meg and Calvin It was so bad it should have been Hillary Duff playing the part or one of the likes This movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book I cant believe Disney could even get away with making such a cheap basic rendition If youve ever read the book I think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of Lord of the Rings equivalence This movie should have never been able to use the title of A Wrinkle in Time Poorly done

1	This story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last Harem of the Ottoman empire well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone and learn about the people who lived therebr br I enjoyed the story characters acting and scenes A few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly otherwise a wonderful piecebr br The main character Safiya is played wonderfully by Marie Gillain who I am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it The scenes with her and Alex Descas Nadir are charming and lovelybr br I recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less Hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating
1	The Movie was subpar but this Television Pilot delivers a great springboard into what has become a SciFi fans Ideal program The Actors deliver and the special effects for a television series are spectacular Having an intelligent interesting script doesnt hurt eitherbr br Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorite programs
0	This film lacked something I couldnt put my finger on at first charisma on the part of the leading actress This inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man Even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play It could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors I just dont knowbr br But could it have been the screenplay Just exactly who was the chef in love with He seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits than of anybody or anything else He never convinced me he was in love with the princessbr br I was disappointed in this movie But dont forget it was nominated for an Oscar so judge for yourself
0	Why do all movies on Lifetime have such anemic titles An Unexpected Love ooh how provocative This Much I know would have been better The film is nothing special Real people dont really talk like these characters do and the situations are really hackneyed The straight woman who turns lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character If you wanna watch two hot women kiss in a very discreet fashion you might enjoy this Although it seems like it was written by someone who doesnt really get out in the world to observe people Why am I wasting my time writing about it
1	Anyone who has seen this movie and reviewed it poorly I would refer them to Roger Eberts review of this movie He is one of the most respected Critics in the industry and he gave it 3 12 Starsbr br This is a great movie It may not be perfect or spectacular but I enjoyed it A Chorus Line is not so much a story as it is a group of stories about the lives of Broadway hopefuls I read reviews where people said that too much time was wasted on the romance between Zach and Cassie That is an incorrect view It is another story along with all the other stories that are told about each of the Broadway hopefuls What people fail to realize is that those who are dancers for Broadway shows go through the same things that the common man goes through And that I think is really the point of the whole show It is to showcase not only the talent of these special dancers but to give us some poignant things to think about in regard to life in general This is a study of life as a Broadway star Anyone who has dreamed of becoming a Broadway star watches this movie with a great feeling of relationship because they have gone through exactly what the characters are going through br br This is a great musical It has its slow points and at times gets a little confused with the pacing of certain story lines but all in all I thoroughly enjoyed it Take a closer look at the movie and then maybe you will understand what I am talking about
1	This is how movies are supposed to be made a fascinating setting characters about whom you come to care deeply writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense This is a wonderful film deeply moving without being sentimental Highly recommended
1	Its a bit easy Thats about itbr br The graphics are clean and realistic except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d but thats forgiveable The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games The sounds are magnificant Everything from the speaking to the SFX are pleasant and realisticbr br The camera angle is a bit frustrating at times but its the same for every platform game like BanjoKazooie and Donkey Kong 64br br I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997 and since then I have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times
1	Yes thats right it is I firmly believe that the N64 and the weird looking controller were both designed just so this game could be made It was amazing the first time I saw it with its huge environments and colorful characters and its amazing now The play control is perfect the graphics are beautiful and it has that Nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there A must have for any N64 owner and a reason to get an N64 for everyone else
0	For months Ive been hearing about this little movie and now Ive seen it I find it cute cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other peoples creative ideas in order to make their own onejoke premise of a movie Troops Swingblade any of the million Blair Witch parodies come to mind If all that these directors want is a foot inside Hollywoods door then theyre doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how Hollywood makes films How many times have you heard the phrase Its Animal House meets Back to the Future Its Wall Street meets Dead Poets Society or Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars I remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable
1	Excellent movie albeit slightly predictable I have to comment on Nicole Kidmans acting in this movie Some of her other works havent shown the amazing talent this woman has but Birthday Girl doesnt suffer from this in the slightest Even without words Kidmans acting shines through
1	The fluttering of butterfly wings in the Atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the Pacific According to this theory somehow related to the Chaos Theory Im not sure exactly how every action no matter how small or insignificant will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events This small jewel of a film shows us a series of seeminglyunrelated characters most of them in Paris whose actions will affect each others lives The sixdegreesofseparation theory can be applied as well Each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film The acting is finelytuned and nuanced Audrey Tautou is luminous the stories mesh plausibly the humor is just right and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement
1	I really like Miikes movies about Yakuza this one I saw about 2 years ago and it really fued my head Never before seen such a sick and twisted thing The Story is good and the actors do their thing very well I havent seen the UK or Japan version but I have to say that I believe that the German DVD is a bit censored If you havent seen the movie already and live in Germany maybe you better look out for a DVD from the Nederlands or Austria The ION DVD contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes but at the showdown I felt that something was missing about one or two very short scenesbr br All in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence thats what I like Miike for
0	i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good right how wrong i was br br i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey a directorwriter of wiseguy making his feature debut blah well the directorwriter of Edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man because i cannot see how he along with the other actors in the film would ever agree to be in this disaster br br this movie is absolutely appalling its a mixture of every cop hard boiled cliché ever there is nothing new with Edison the acting was bad and the direction was even worse it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy this was the best casted direct to video movie ive ever seen br br some examples of just bad silly moments in Edison morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles llcoolj driving a vintage firebird 3 guys being shot in the headbr br this movie is the opposite of goodbr br STAY AWAY FROM EDISON
0	I cant believe blockbuster carries this movie It was SO BAD I was totally fooled by the box art DONT BE FOOLED Its not worth your time I promise you I dont know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or what I am so disappointed br br The description on the back of the box doesnt even match The girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper The synopsis on the back says she is only 17 Did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it Those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be If anyone actually liked this flick then Ive lost all faith in humanitybr br And dont even get me started on the story compared to the title Or the fact that the entire movie was done all in 2 locations Or that the cops didnt even have close to real uniforms Why would i even say that Who cares about the cops uniforms Compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on br br This movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans
0	Gday Mates just watched Croc Hunter the movie it was alright but the show seems more real this just seemed like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with funnier lines and more characters A few things Steve described snakes Fangs like hypodermic needles yeeeowch for reals you know that hurts and cant they jump up high hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff There was two MAJOR cleavage shots in this movie when Terry find that baby joey she goes like We have to nurture them just like a baby Woah i thought she was gonna up breast feed that kid that woulda made it PG13 though While on Terry did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show Terrys knowledge on ritual mating she knows her sex stuffs movie takes place in Queensland Austrailia I want a koala dingo and joeybr br Steves dog Sui actually has a purpose in this movie albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamitewielding hottiebr br Oh and if anyone else watches this try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was RIGHT in shotgunning the croc he was eating her sheep i would be mad too
0	In fact these young people were so distasteful that I couldnt wait for all of em to get slaughtered and that includes Clarissa Joanna Canton since I considered her the most annoying of the bunchbr br But I knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen Christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the Leslie Gore music playing in the background It had nowhere to go but downbr br Even the prosthetics looked fake and the blood looked suspiciously like Hawaiian Punch although later on it took on red dayglo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing Im sure all the GOTH morons out there will appreciate this bullsht since itll appeal to that bunch It sure didnt appeal to me Blahbr br And not even my favorite horror babe Adrienne Barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself She still looks hot though Im glad she takes care of herself since we dont get to see too much of her nowadaysbr br However it is a step up from Dante Tomasellis meandering HORROR 2002 in that it has a somewhat coherent plot so Ill give it that much That and the little Boston terrier named Boozer also brings it up a notch I like what Boozer does to Clarissa in the end It was the only good scene in an otherwise silly filmbr br Lions Gate Films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one upbr br 2 out of 10
0	Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I have ever seen They have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest mosteasilyoffended viewers which for CBC means 85 year old farmers in Saskatchewan The jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame I cant believe it The performances are very hammy and over acted but I dont blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the CBC asked for and demanded Very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as controversial well it is less controversial than the other boring CBC comedies like The Hour Has 22 Minutes Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercers Report
0	Sorry did i miss something did i walk out early The first ten minutes of unusual and untrue stories had me thinking This is going to be a classic But it was all down hill from there The acting was brilliant for what its worth William H Macy is fantastic and just gets better and better every film i watch him in But it never seemed to connect I was waiting for the big moment where all the stories inter connect and then suddenlyit rains frog it was if the writer said ive gone to deep how can i pull all these stories together cleverelyOh sod it ill just have it raining frogs I like clever movies i like strange movies but this was just odd and boring 410
1	I got in to this excellent program in about season 4 and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on DVD and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10 It now may not have Richard Dean Anderson now but the addition of Ben Browder and Claudie Black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after 10 seasons Sadly now the scifi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a 11 season there are making two direct to DVD movie and hopefully more Atlantis is still going strong on its 4th seasons And there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead This TV show is a must see for all scifi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people Watch IT 1010
1	It is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all agesto children for a fine narrative and a wonderful colorful production and to adults for a literate script fine production values good castingacting all bound together with a fine Rozsa score Two roughly contemporary films accomplish thisThief of Baghdad 1940 and The Adventures of Robin Hood 1938 Some of the back story on this production is fascinating This production commenced in England in the summer of 1939 moved to Hollywood and proved a cover for British intelligence efforts The producer Alexander Korda was subsequently knighted in 1942 Here is a unique case of the intersection of art commerce and politics By all means secure a good CD of this film for your library
0	This is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues That is no exaggeration you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with itbr br I sincerely thought Fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does ErwinElvira suicides at the end but instead of this in every scene somebody is trying to explain when he was young this happened and he just came back from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there etcbr br Soon in the movie ErwinElvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat and while telling her the story of Elviras life Fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other It is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying Of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of I have suffered much in my life and am about to diebr br In one of the sparse moments where actually happens something ErwinElvira encounters a former lover that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality is that he recognizes Elvirabr br There are some interesting shots and ideas I must admit such as when the nun tells the story of the young Erwin but everything on the movie is wasted due to Fassbinders self indulgence
1	good movie good music good background and an acceptable plot but the main point again as his movies tend to be the man is the best actor in idia and can turn dust into gold nana patekar this may be his second best performance after parinda others may disagree although other movies are not far behind one man that will never ever disappoint youbr br good movie although i think shahrukh was a luxury this movie could have done without you can see in his movies others try very hard to reach his heights and act out of their skins but this man is really something elasebr br the movie is cool the music and direction is excellent plot a bit thin but the screen play and dialog again very good a must watch

1	I enjoyed this movie Havent seen Andy Griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly Ive associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that hes versatilebr br I wasnt troubled that Dottys anxiety disorder may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook There are zillions of whateverphobias and neuroses and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms She is clearly a sensitive with extrasensory powers as was understood by the local Indians but not by any Anglos It is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentricbr br Although this is taken to be a light family movie it is actually more sophisticated than it seems Also Hirams twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle Its fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance
1	Every time I see Nicole I like her more I love a movie like this A woman you just wont give up on but she keeps breaking your heart First movie I remember seeing like this was Of Human Bondage the Kim Novak Laurence Harvey version The beefs about the correctness of the Russian spoken in this film are petty it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who cant speak Russian Im sure Funny how people miss the point The nogoodnik Russian guys were well cast too Finally I have to tip my hat to Ben Chaplin as somebody else noted he plays a sap with great dignity and there was definitely some heat between him and Nicole To think guys get PAID for that mindblowing
1	Good show very entertaining Good marshal arts acting Good story plot The entire main crew did a nice job from Robert Urich to Chuck Norris Jennifer Tung and especially a BIG hand to Judson Mills An especially fine tribute to Robert Urich in his latter days A GREAT actor who will be truly missed
1	This Night Listener is better than people are generally saying It has weaknesses and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis no doubt but I think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this The whole thing feels like one of those fireside this happened to a friend of a friend of mine ghost stories One big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate Everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility and real life just sort of plods alongno So there are no flashy endings or earthshattering revelations no showdown scenes Thank Heaven You have to get into the zone when watching this movie forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a conventionallygood movie Williams isnt terrific but he easily meets the needs of the story plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic No One as he is the Everyman the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story Toni Collettes performance should be nominated for an Oscar even if she maybe shouldnt win it Give it a shot For quality and content alone The Night Listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days
0	Well at least my theater group did lol So of course I remember watching Grease since I was a little girl while it was never my favorite musical or story it does still hold a little special place in my heart since its still a lot of fun to watch I heard horrible things about Grease 2 and thats why I decided to never watch it but my boyfriend said that it really wasnt all that bad and my friend agreed so I decided to give it a shot but I called them up and just laughed First off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasnt really clever not to mention they just used the same characters but with different names and actors Tell me how did the Pink Ladies and TBirds continue years on after the former gangs left Not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy gee what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these TBirds were just stupid and ridiculousbr br Another year at Rydell and the music and dancing hasnt stopped But when a new student who is Sandys cousin comes into the scene he is love struck by a pink lady Stephanie But she must stick to the code where only Pink Ladies must stick with the TBirds so the new student decides to train as a TBird to win her heart So he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the TBirds butts But will he tell Stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own Well find out for yourselfbr br Grease 2 is like a silly TV show of some sort that didnt work The gang didnt click as well as the first Grease did not to mention Frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable because I thought that she graduated from Rydell but apparently she didnt The songs were not really that catchy Im glad that Michelle was able to bounce back so fast but thats probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel I wouldnt really recommend this film other than if you are curious but I warned you this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musicalbr br 210
1	To me this review may contain spoilers but I like watching movies with NO idea of what is going to happen so therefore I think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilersbr br I just watched this movie again and I must reiterate that it has the BEST ending to any movie Ever Ever Ever The real translation The Beating of the Butterflys Wings is oddly not used as the translated title I suppose they thought most Americans wouldnt know what Chaos Theory is except for those who saw or read Jurassic Park The movie is based on chaos theory and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events which all lead back to one event The movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters about 20 In a way the ending seems inevitable despite this but if you think about it it is a perfect ending Think to yourself what else needed to be said It is at the same time a very brave ending Too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one but an ending like this would NEVER come out of Hollywoodbr br
0	The storyline was okay Akshay Kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie Kareena Kapoor looked bad There was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner I dont know why the hell did Anil Kapoor accepted such a bad role There was nothing much to do for him in the movie Just because it is a Yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is Said Ali khan was alright I think that it is high time that Indian directors and producers start thinking of Indian customers as intelligent lot What are we fools What do they think they will show 2 men taking on a SWAT squad to teeters and we will believe them Is the Indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals they take an entire squad of 100 policemen and no one was there to surround the palace The action was crap and I have never seen such bad action Akshay Kumar was between a circle of 3040 policemen all shooting at him and he shooting back at them None of the policemens bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen Crap CRAPbr br I think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirementbr br I strongly recommend NOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE
1	This series could very well be the best Britcom ever and that is saying a great deal considering the competitors Fawlty Towers Good Neighbours to name just twobr br What made Butterflies so superior even to the best of the best is that it did not just exemplify great classic classy and intelligent comedy but it also expanded horizons reflecting flawlessly gently and at every detail the great social change that was occurring in Britain at the timebr br I remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it The lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself This was the first time I saw real people using cordless phones And the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in North America at the time Then there were the decors shop fronts cars These people even the layabout sons with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor were sophisticated They were examples of the New Europeans that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade 1980sbr br Of course the premise was strange and fantastic The idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary particularly to North Americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things sure the situation was depicted in American movies and TV but not with the intensity of Butterflies or the movie Montenegro And if the premise was not surprising enough the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme A potential affair that was not really about sex or even romance Butterflies dazzled many but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief at the time anywaybr br Butterflies turned out to be in so many ways prophetic It documented ahead of its time postmodern ennui allpervasive lifestyle the notion of emotional infidelity and generational disconnect and male discontent portrayed perfectly by the strained fatherson relationships It is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come
1	I work at a movie store and as such I am always on the lookout for an excellent movie I decided to check out Nothing as it sat in our Canadian section and Ive been trying to support my countrys movie industry I was in for a surprise The film features David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationshipswithout working that hard It is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters as well as some funny exchanges We cant be dead we have cable What more can I say without noting that it is worth a shot even if you abandon it within the first half an hour
1	I know it is fashionable now to hate this movie I have seen hundreds of spook films including he original 1963 Haunting as well as most of the Hammer films This film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it Yet many viewers can accept out of control films like Scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts Actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great I have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time The director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring Perhaps this film might appeal more to John Carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963 It was even more scary See both and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin
0	This movie is a joke I mean a ha ha funny joke Why Because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh I got at the sheer ridiculousness of nonsensical inane plot and horrible acting Wowbr br Within this movie there are so many unanswered questions for example why do these women become zombies and how Why are there four black women who are zombies caretakers and what is their purpose Since when does 6 people make up a nation of Zombies And is smeared black eye mascara scary to anyone anywhere Even a 2 year oldbr br And lastly Why was this movie made at all Why why why No answer Thats what I thoughtbr br On the demand channel they actually issued this comment after the synopsis of the movie We apologize for this movie in advance LOL At least they had the decency to do this much
1	Spoilers Following I picked up the book Evil Angels when it first came out knowing nothing of the case Just to give the press and the Austrialian people a break here I was quite far into it before I began to question the Chamberlains guilt The author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did John Bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors and picked up by the press of the arterial spray the actelone plates Dr James Camerons certainty that the collar was cut with scissors that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up bloody hand print etc all quite convincingly After all these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasnt apparent to me at all It was also highly technical evidence difficult for a layman to understand To this point beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human people didnt believe it was possible The public was suspicious of the Seventh Day Adventists whose origins made them appear to be a cult and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt Were it not for dedicated selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony finding Azarias clothes later would not have been enough to get Lindy out of jail The book shook me for that reason and Ive been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyones guilt ever since excepting OJ of course I was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and dont think it could have been done better Ive always liked Sam who I could identify with completely and Meryl was perfect as always Beautiful photography haunting music I think its not only a very good but a very important movie Too bad it didnt receive more publicity at the time it was released

0	Sometime I fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie I had had a trauma after watching Welcome 2007 and thought that they wont do it again But after loads of amazing promos Tashan finally ended as heart attackbr br Such amazing 3 songs in promo Dil Haara Chhaliya and Tashan Mein and what u get in the movie Zero story predictable plot plenty of Akshay Kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching Kareena after her major weight lossbr br Musicwise another major disaster in the music album they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these 4 jokers and they havent thought of giving the background song of the scenes when Akshay Kumar is doing stunts that song is such nice quite comparable to Tashan Mein and that is not taken in the music album If you plan to watch this movie i would say watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like Bachchan Bachchan Pandeybr br Overall very disappointed even with the way Bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad Englishbr br Go away man i need to puke
0	It had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance The plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker for watching it The production was good however the script and acting were Bmovie quality The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors The good actors didnt hold their own nor did they lift up the others br br This movie is not worthy of more words but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines James Wood and Cuba Gooding Jr play caricatures of themselves in other movies br br If you are looking for mindless entertainment I still wouldnt recommend this movie
1	I have just seen this film and fallen in love with it There is a little bit of something for everyone and its a particular free for all when it comes to the romance between Lachlan and Lil When they are on the beach I nearly cried there is the unspoken realization that time is the most precious commodity and it is most evident when they are together This idea taken from several angles from marriage to sibblings to finding love in the least conventional of places The film almost makes you long for that kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow could very well be your last Crowe was particularly wonderful in his role of Lachlan Ive always had a soft spot for the accent but I nearly melted with his portrayal of his character The way this film was shot is also beautiful with the music backdrop of the open fields and superb acting All together this is a wonderful film that tugs at all of human emotions
1	Starring Jim Carrey Morgan Freeman Jennifer Anniston I was really quite skeptical the first time I watched this movie I mean what a conceptual NIGHTMARE Jim Carrey playing God Nothing is sacred anymorebr br Well this movie is hardly sacred but it also is not sacrilegious at least not to any great extent Yes Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a while but he is not God Confused Ill give you the low downbr br Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life He lives with his beautiful girlfriend Grace Anniston and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other but the relationship is on fairly shaky groundbr br Then Bruce gets a shot at anchorman only to have it underhandedly stolen by Evan Baxter Obviously not please Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him firedbr br Much complaining and griping about God later Bruce gets a page After a while he gets tired of it calling so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building heh There he meets God Freeman who is the Boss Electrician and Janitor of the building I found this highly amusing God is the Boss the Holy Spirit is the Electrician and Jesus Christ is the Janitor Think about it Boss obvious Electrician the guy who keeps everything running Janitor the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left BRILLIANTbr br Anyway Bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met God but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing God he starts to believe a bit Wonder why Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemiesbr br Since this is Hollywood Bruce obviously eventually smartens up learns his lesson and starts using his powers for the good of the world In the end he cries out for God to take it away and prays that His will be done not Brucesbr br Since it is Jim Carrey the movie is quite amusing and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it The movie is not perfect theology but for Hollywood it is definitely a good attempt Many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this moviebr br So while far from perfect definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind itbr br Bottom Line 35 out of 4 worth a view or two

1	Narratives  whether written visual or poetic epics  generally try to avoid too may characters readers and viewers after all can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who This is especially true in film I think simply because we cannot easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema Viewers like myself however dont have that problem because we see all our films on DVD or VHSbr br A year ago I was introduced to Audrey Tautou a French actress whom I first saw in The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain 2001 and later in A Very Long Engagement 2004 both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large cast of characters This earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways more characters and more complexitybr br Now other directors have used those techniques before Robert Altman with The Player 1992 Short Cuts 1993 Gosford Park 2001 and others Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia 1999 Stanley Kramer did it with A Mad Mad Mad Mad World in 1963 a comedy of almost epic proportions The difference with this film is first the director lets us see inside the head of some of the characters and second some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewers memory as the story flipflops between different time periodsbr br The basic  the core so to speak  story concerns a young woman Irene Tautou who is told by a fellow commuter on a train that she will meet her true love on that day This occurs in the first few minutes of the film The clever irony at this point is that Irene doesnt realize that the young man opposite Gilbert Robin may be that one true love And nor does hebr br They go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter However chaos results throughout the rest of the day not only for the two young people but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and interwoven vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere and yetbr br If the story were simply that it could tend to be boring and even quite predictable Not so The script and the director rip into our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are all too commonplace but which are turned into believable extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again For example the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours consider your alternatives two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before Irene and her man of destiny meet again Or what about a stone chip flying onto your windscreen Consider again what would happenbr br All of that is interesting enough What was more interesting for me was assessing each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was THE ONE for Irene or whether it was in fact the young man on the train That kept me guessing for a whilebr br Ill let you think about that should you see this delightful rompbr br Recommended for all

0	Thoughtless ignorant illconceived careerkilling where is the talented Angela Jones now deeply unfunny garbage Its no wonder Reb Braddock hasnt directed anything else since anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules based on his own script with the help of Quentin Tarantino himself and creates something like THIS anyone who feels that THIS was a story worth telling to the world doesnt deserve a second break Under the circumstances the performances are good the actors do what theyre told to do and they do it well Its just that they shouldnt have done it in the first place br br 0 out of 4
1	Ive just watched Roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be Toby Malones performance really stood out I found myself actually caring about what happens to Matt throughout the whole of the film which itself is a lot of fun very pacey with a good mix of well rounded characters quite an achievement considering its short running time There are plenty of good twists throughout as well it will keep you guessing until the end Other characters to watch out for are the totally insane Tiny and the sneaky attractive Jesse It may not have the huge budget of a Hollywood blockbuster but dont let that put you off you could do a lot worse than checking this out you wont regret it Good Fun 710
1	I would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of Season 10 br br The final episode of the 10th season Unending where it would certainly appear that the Asgard have been killedoff in a very rushed unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion left me in disbelief br br From the extremely rushed end of the series its obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season My guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the Stargate SG1 franchise for the two upcoming directtoDVD movesbr br Unless the Asgard return in a future SG1 movie with a very good explanation of the apparent extinction I think that the fans have been cheated with a poor cleanup of looseendsbr br Poor end to an otherwise brilliant scifi series
0	I dont know who to blame the timid writers or the clueless director It seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars Angie Charlie Denise Rosanna and Jon that there wasnt enough left to really make a movie This could have been very entertaining but there was a veil of timidity even cowardice that hung over each scene Since it got an R rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70yearold woman and not Angie Harmon Why does Sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships WITH TWO OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY ACTRESSES in the world If they were only looking for laughs why not cast Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead This was so predictable I was surprised to find that the director wasnt a five year old What a waste not just for the viewers but for the actors as well
0	First of all I just want to say that I LOVE this show But this episodethis episode makes a mockery of the entire showbr br I dont know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the WORST episode in the entire seriesbr br There is no story line everything is chaotic and the jokesare crapbr br The way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game For example how do the furlings look like by creating that stupid previously onis simply embarrassingbr br Its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad
1	Very interesting and moving documentary about the World Trade Center tragedy on 11th September 2001The main theme of it is the heroism of American firefighters who tried to rescue as many people as they couldThe film is deeply emotional and rather disturbingmany people seen on screen have lost their livesRecommended
0	Reviewing KAZAAM and saying its a bad movie isnt hard at allafter all critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves excoriating this filmsaying it was among the worst films of the decade So the fact that I say its bad or anyone else says its bad is certainly no surprise Its like someone talking about WWIIpractically no one says that was a GOOD thing right The question I have and no place on IMDb can answer it is why did they make this in the first place After all its obvious to anyone who isnt severely brain injured that the film would be horrible But movies like ED a baseball playing chimp COOL AS ICE starring the everpopular Vanilla Ice TROLL 2 which doesnt even have any trolls in it BABY GENIUSES Einstainlike superhero babies and PINOCCHIO IN OUTER SPACE huh prove that any idea no matter how dumb can make it to the big screen So the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright normal br br The film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school Like the punk from FREE WILLY this kid is somehow misunderstood in other words a total brat and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is by the end of the film hell have learned something and grown Just once I want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film Eventually while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him the genie Kazaam Shaquille ONealis accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes But the kid doesnt believe him AND the genies magic seems a tad rustybr br Eventually the brat does realize that Kazaam is for real However unlike most kids he withholds making his wishes so in the meantime Kazaam is forced to follow him around everywherelike his own personal servant And according to the cliché you know that by the end of the film Max and Kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed Oh and Max will have come to terms with his absent father and moms fiancé Im gonna gag Apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishesbr br As for Kazaam Shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rapvery poorly Im a middleaged white guy and I think I could probably rap at least as well Hes an amazing basketball player and Ive heard hes a nice guybut a rapperno way As far as his acting goes he wasnt great but had such a nice personality in the film that its hard to hate himeven if they made him do a lot of very stupid thingsbr br So is the movie as excruciatingly awful as youve probably heard through the first twothirds of the movie I would have said no Shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script However later in the film the bad becomes horridas Kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when hes really needed And out of nowhere the plot gets really really weirdas the guy who wants to make Kazaam a rap star turns out to be an evil mobster And oddly this guy seems to accept that Kazaam is a genie with no hesitation br br In addition the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill Max and his dad I know that the kid was annoying but this is supposed to be a kids film What part of trying to kill the kid didnt the writers not understand Then in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history Kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a druginduced hallucination This ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in THE BLACK HOLEand boy did it make my brain hurt Uggghhthe horrible dialog was just too much to bearbr br Overall its a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane Yes folks with a messed up message bizarre nonkid friendly material and horrible characters this is one wretched film Sadly given the idea and actors its hard to imagine the final product turning out much worsebr br By the way if you want to see a Genie in a modern world film that is GOOD try the British made for TV film Bernard and the Geniea charming and exceptionally wellwritten film from start to finish
0	I rented this flick for one reason Tom Savini I respect his work but this was a real let down I had horrible clichés half of the film was naked women so called fallen angels running around trying to act scary oh and then there was the occasional Blair Witch black and white motion sicken camera scenes Toms character was really awful Horrible script And you got to love these lines they use Is anyone there who is out there this isnt funny No but your acting was I wish I could give this flick a 0 Oh the names of the characters Judd Molly Ally Emilio but they did leave out Anthony The Breakfast Club reunite in the forest of unforgivable acting
0	Why did I waste my money on this on the last day of Sundance I want a refund Can I have my 16 back While I was watching this film I kept waiting for something to happen nothing did happen The only way I even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot which was not really like the film why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out It was not very artistic Why did the director show Lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes Why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading Or was that the point I felt like Phantom Love had no story at all and to be honest I felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film
0	They must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the Hollywood bus station They then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived You know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot four young boys playing in grainy slow motion accompanied by voice over narration Next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion Once theyre grown its easy to spot the writerdirector among the four Hes the quiet contemplative longhaired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants This means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from Hickville to Hollywood Only theres no writing or directing talent on display here And if you still cant figure out which one he is heres a hint The auteur and his character have the same middle name It took over an hour to figure out that these twentysomething men were supposed to still be in high school What looked like a prison was apparently a high school the warden turned out to be the principal Once more the poor misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement murder and pillage but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father How about hitting back kid like you do everyone else Numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose Howlingly bad dialogue Many scenes badly out of focus Cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience Overacting in the extreme And if you dont quite get the selfimportant speeches or the slowmotion scenes just listen to the overbearing music It will clue you in and what youre supposed to feel Poor Marisa Ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films The biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies run over puppies chained to a tree rob and steal all the while complaining about their sad sorry lives But if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college Yeah thats the ticket Why is it that every twentysomething filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important so interesting that the world cant wait to see it onscreen If this movie is as autobiographical as it seems then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants
1	Difficult film to comment on how do you say its bad Well it isnt but then its equally difficult to say it is good What it is is compelling viewing it is as close as you will get to utter devastation without being there It is the photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of Thailand brought to life you know you want to turn away but you have to watchbr br The Naudet brothers handle the commentary very well even in the most tragic of circumstances there view on something which is happening in another country neither panders nor insults The facts are on the cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand or comprehend what is going onbr br You cant change history and you should not want this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour
1	I could see this film is super He didnt surprise to oneself when so that it was taking place for the truth this way by itself how swigged flight to the which didnt have the place but it is only such an conspiratorial theory Rightbr br Very I liked watching this film when I was the child I am interesting which so that it was if it turned out that such a flight was taking place really certainly to it for not a belief because it is denying logic and the common sense Who at healthy senses sent to kids with space shuttle into the orbit I very like reading for the subject American and Soviet space programs I know a few missions of space shuttles remained provided by CIA with the clause TOP SECRET certainly these are only such my divagations but who knows
1	For a film that got little publicity and few people have heard about this was pretty good Its another one of these modernday British crime films that are quirky Snatch Sexy Beast etc Its not wild like Snatch but its interesting and it has some rough charactersbr br It also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show not late has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the firsttime viewer Basically its about a lowkey British male who sends away for a Russian mail order bride who winds up with the aid of two Russian male friends providing a couple of big surprisesbr br Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman costar and are very good as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidmans Russian cohorts This is a different kind of film and wellacted Kidman once again proves shes far more than just a beautiful face

0	OK so I hear about this new Justin Timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names I mean great actors like The Freeman aka Morgan Freeman an asset to Hollywood however completely wasted in this film Then we got Kevin Spacey who Ive been a great fan of ever since I watched American Beauty and The Usual Suspects Both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as I did when I heard the story Then enter a fresh faced Justin Timberlake I say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes havent hit him yet Well the reason for that I might add is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review The movie is so terrible that when i got into the first 15 minutes of it The characters were so one dimensional that it makes some Bible characters look like the Don Corleone They got the one liners and soundbite worthy stuff The token troubled black guy LL COOL J who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life The captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone And what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience Oh and lots of gun fire i mean a whole lot SPOILERNOT THe kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force whos crooked dead and the hero prevails They got flame throwers and rocket launchers REally no kiddingbr br Bottom line if you want to see Edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors or a great fan of Justin Timberlake to all the 13 year old girls out there enjoy I wish i had more hands because then I would have more thumbs because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happeningbr br MAY GD HAVE MERCY ON US ALL and save us from these terrible movies Well it could be worst another RNB terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher hehe check out IN THE MIX lol or even Get rich or die trying Now the special thing about that movie is that its got 30 year old men playing 16 or even younger teens I could go on with these
0	While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start Although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there the pace of The Gathering is slow the makeup somewhat inadequate and the plot confusing Worse the characterization in the premiere episode is poor Although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems I remember The Gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series
0	I had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a Yashraj Filmbr br Jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by Pooja Singh to teach her boss Lakhan Singh English The two fall in love and decide to run away but Pooja tells Jimmy that she cant do this as she owes a debt to Lakhan Singh who is also known as Bhaiyyaji But they decide and steal money from him and its only then that Jimmy finds out that Bhaiyyaji Lakhan Singh is a Don In the meantime Bhaiyyaji hires a man Bachchan Pandey to track down Jimmy and Poojabr br Starring Saif Ali Khan Kareena Kapoor Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar the movie is directed by first time director Viay Krishna Acharya and is produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Choprabr br Tashan has to be one of the worse films that I have ever watched Yes The scenery is good and Kareena Kapoor and her much publicised weight loss looks good But plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other hence why I have said at the beginning that I had expected more from this film as it was a Yashraj Production With reference to songs unfortunately there is not one song that I can remember nowbr br There are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to Akshaye Kumar and Saif could have definitely done better while Kareena Kapoor played her part well But this cannot be said for Anil Kapoor it did not suit him at all as a villain Lastlynever mind Aditya Chopra who in the past has produced and directed good films such as Mohabbatein what was Yash Chopra doing by producing such a trash movie br br Conclusion Bad movie not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression
0	This Movie had some great actors in it Unfortunately they had forgotten how to act I was hoping the movie would get better as it went along but the acting was so robotic it was doomed from the very start It actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script the whole time Maybe it was the Musical score or the Director himself but one thing is for sure the Makeup artist needs to get another job The Facial Powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors faces Would not recommend this movie to anyone no wonder it never hit the Theaters Cuba Gooding Jr James Woods shame on you guys for not giving it your all The Plot was great just needed a whole lot more
0	Who could possibly have wished for a sequel to Bert I Gordons legendary bad trashfilm Food of the Gods Nobody of course but director Damien Lee thought it was a good idea anyway and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history Gnaw is a sequel in name only as the setting moved to a typical late 80s location a university campus and also the cheap cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the 80s This script hangs together by clichés awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other and more successful horror classics Neil Hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growingexperiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor Due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus Following the good old tradition that Spielbergs Jaws started theres an obnoxious Dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere During a hysterically grotesque climax the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus new sport complex Gnaw Food of the Gods 2 is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch The characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff like descending into the sewers unarmed while they KNOW its infested with rats the acting is atrocious and theres a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growthserum I wonder what Freuds theory would be on that Theres a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and  it has to be said  the music is surprisingly atmospheric In case you just cant get enough of this junk there are quite a lot of creaturefeatures revolving on mutated rats like the Italian schlock film Rats Night of Terror the modest 70s cult film Willard and its lame sequel Ben the 2003 Willard remake starring Crispin Glover and the surprisingly good recent ratmovies by oncefamous directors Tibor Ticaks Rats and John Lafia The Rats Go nuts
1	When I saw Birthday Girl I liked it so much I set out to see every Nicole Kidman film I could only to find all of them a disappointment compared to it I theorize that while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of their artistic control with Nicole Kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to film enjoymentIMHO Thus for instance Dogville even depriving the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential insight she is hammering home or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of anyone elses attention or other pet causes of Kidmans br br Here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job I dont how or who was able to restrain her but apparently it worked The way the film depicts her openness despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman And consequently what makes a mans most desperate hopes marginally attainable br br Of course the fact the male lead transforms from a milquetoast clerk to macho man in the space of one film sounds like a male ego expansion fantasy but his transformation is adequately believable It isnt coyly contrived as it would be in a film engineered to bolster male ego Instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstancesbr br Also quite charming is the way the criminals are portrayed as perfectly human apart from their criminal mission Her gang has a coed rough and tumble fellowship which is foreign to American culture And while they are his adversaries they are never really his enemy In effect they teach him to be competebr br I really marveled at Kidmans ability to physically appear Russian It had me wondering whether her ancestry was Russian but none of the photos of her I examined showed any hint of it Maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing br br I can only hope that they knock her over the head again soon so she can turn out another great film Despite my gratuitous digs at Ms kidman the message is this is a superior film in every way and probably the role of a lifetime
1	I managed to catch a late night double feature last night of Before Sunrise 1995 and Before Sunset 2004 and saw both films in a row without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately After sleeping it over I have to say that I largely prefer the former over the latter and I shall explain whybr br Before Sunrise introduces us with then young actors Ethan Hawke Reality Bites Dead Poets Society only 25 at the time of the films release and Julie Delpy the Three Colors trilogy then 26 although looking much younger He is a promiscuous American writer touring Europe after breaking up with his girlfriend She is a young French student on her way home to Paris They meet on the BudapestVienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together The two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of Vienna exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on lovebr br The film has 1990s written all over it back then technology was leaping rapidly the new millennium with all its hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future The characters of Jesse Hawke and Celine Delpy with all their flaws and inconsistencies Celines accent if by mistake or on purpose was half Americanhalf French and it swinged from one spectrum to the other breaking the characters credibility were a mirror of the time Watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement acting all clichéd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well is what really made this movie work for me The fact that the director doesnt let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth whilebr br All in all Sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of Vienna a well told classical romantic rendezvous and a film I will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future

1	Having seen CUBE Ive been a fan of Vincenzo Natalis work Natali seems to have this inept ability to take a storyline and hardly wring it our like a wet towel for all the storyline he can muster Instead he lets the stories themselves unfold in natural ways so much in fact that you may in fact believe there is this Cube were people try to escape or in the case of NOTHING a large empty expanse where there is nothing The advert had me hooked instantly It seemed so simple Take two characters who no one likes and send them to a world where there is nothing Natali does this so simply that you forget the logic that a place where there is nothing cannot exist In fact the world of nothing becomes something of an irony within the film Theres nothing there but also something therebr br It might be a good time to point out that the trailer is highly misleading I was fortunate enough to actually understand that the film leaned to a more comedic side than the trailer otherwise told so Therefore upon watching the film i laughed every now and again whereas someone who the advert mislead may find themselves utterly confusedbr br If i may take a minute to give the film some praise where the film excels on is the concept It is a genius concept to have a world of nothing and to put two characters there NOT two brilliant minded characters who will philosophise and work out their surroundings but two idiots who have absolutely no clue as to where the hell they are Another strong point is the films cinematography though at first this may not seem it Where each wall north earth south west up and down is just a white plane a perception of depth becomes faulty It is hard to determine where things are placed in the MisEnScene The cinematography has many moments where this actually happens but for the most part the camera is placed so that two characters or an object and a character are placed in the foreground and background allowing a sense of depth to be realisedbr br However this film does lack in certain areas The film is relatively short but even so after a while the novelty of this world of nothing becomes rather dull and you wish to find some form of resolution within the plot We can also argue that the acting is once again questionable These two characters are in a sense unlikeable therefore we feel no sympathy at any point for these characters However on a flip side of that the chemistry and friendship between the two characters seems real enough but there is something lackingbr br Even so i do rank this as a thoroughly enjoyable film Do not let the trailer fool you into thinking this is another sciencefiction horror film It is much more of a comedy than that It is indeed worth watching though purely for the concept itself
1	Pleasant story of the community of Pimlico in London who after an unexploded WW2 bomb explodes find a Royal Charter stating that the area they live in forms part of Burgundybr br This movie works because it appeals to the fantasy a lot of us have about making up our own rules and not having to listen to THEM A solid cast of British stalwarts especially Stanley Holloway makes this more believablebr br There are some very nice moments in the film such as when the people have ran out of supplies and other Londoners on the other side of the barricade start throwing food and other things over to thembr br Even though you always knew Pimlico would become part of the UK again the people of PImlico and as a consequence the viewer doesnt mind when this happens leaving a nice happy feelingbr br Its amazing to think that these low budget movies from a small studio in London still remain so popular over fifty years later The producers must have got something right
1	I saw this movie in 1976 my first year of living in New York I went on to live there for the next 26 yearsbut never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small TV movie It was part of a PBS series as I recall and Ive never forgotten it br br There are no sex scenes to speak of just delicate moving extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement all set within a conservative Boston I think World War 1 environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war and did not seek out a career and financial independence Frances Lee McCain is superb in the role of career photographer and I have spent the next 30 odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no availbr br There has to be a video of this movie Sure it should be on DVD but surely at least a video

1	One of THE comedies of the 1970s Also has the best signature tune of any comedy show The story is about three people sharing a flat living above their landlords George and Mildred The comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing A man and two women Richard O Sullivan is besotted with Paula Wilcox Its played in a gentle and not a leering way which is why this show was such a successbr br The scripts and the stars were always giving the best performances and Richards frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm The end titles contained visual jokes which went unnoticed in the early 1970s but concerned the flat sharers living arrangements
1	As a disclaimer Ive seen the movie 56 times in the last 15 years and I only just saw the musical this week This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasnt in the musical however it tainted me when I watched the musical br br I actually believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role along with Kasey I think her Let me dance for you scene is one of the best parts of the movie a worthwhile addition compared to the musical The dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger easier to do in the movie of course The decors lighting dancing and singing are also much superior in the movie which should be expected and was indeed delivered br br The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to a musical which has few decors The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical
0	Near the closing stages of Baby Mama one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it was all just a mess I really couldnt say it any better than that And while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyones time A lacklustre cast mundane script and vague caricature characters ensure that Baby Mama certainly isnt taxing on the ol noggin but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour Consisting mainly of very routine cliché jokes based around an odd couple rich and poor trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographicbr br As a story on finding love its not that bad but playing this plot line as a sidestory of sorts to work alongside the comedyorientated odd couple tangent characterisation is notably weak resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles As characters themselves both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness so while we may eventually come to find the characters interactions with each other amusing at times the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles we dont feel for the characters and dont find them inherently interesting but rather their dynamic Unfortunately however although this dynamic works best or at least better than the individual personas as mentioned above it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the oddcouple formulabr br Kate Tina Fey is a successful business woman who has hired working class dumbblonde Angie Amy Poehler to be her unlikely surrogate and after Angie decides to leave hopeless husband Carl Dax Shepard both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences Yes its the typical oddcouple premise and one that we have already seen in this years What Happens in Vegas yet what Baby Mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semilayered characters Kate and Angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air In fact the movies only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of Romany Malco who gets lumbered with playing a doorman Of the few times that I laughed during Baby Mama most of those moments were because of this man and the remainder usually fell to Shepardbr br Its a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its scripts themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera and yet director Michael McCullers goes from page to screen effectively enough Yet for a film about babies multimillion dollar business and cultural stereotyping this isnt necessarily a good thing Baby Mama is gradeA hammy plastic tinseltown with capital bore topped with sugar So not only did I feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their twodimensional nature but I simply didnt care for the world they inhabited The dialogue along with sets costumes and the scripts general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the directors incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy these arent characters and that isnt our world in any way so why should I care At the end of the day however a romantic comedys ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests and the frequency of its laughs Baby Mama has little going on in any of these departments Of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair Im sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character Kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored In this respect Baby Mama avoids being unbearable but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch Baby Mama is too lightheaded to be interesting and too shallow to be entertainingbr br A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwwwinvocusnet

1	I have not read the novel though I understand that this is somewhat different from it the fact that I rather enjoyed this coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book Having not read a single word of Austens writing I really cant compare this to any of her work What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever witty and welldelivered as well as the biggest source of comedy in this This made me laugh out loud a lot with perfect British and verbal material Every acting performance is spoton and Paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker The characters are wellwritten credible and consistent I did find a couple of them extremely irritating however and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be funny it tended to get repeated excessively and it honestly wasnt amusing the first time they appeared The editing and cinematography are marvelous and everything looks utterly gorgeous Plot and pacing are great youre never bored It does end in a really obvious manner but maybe thats what the audience of these prefer I cant claim that this did not entertain me it did from start to finish and Id watch it again There is brief language in this I recommend this to any fan of romance stories 710

1	I must confess that I was completely shocked by this film For one I went to see it on a whim expecting something mediocre but given this the most shocking thing was that this was in a populist American cinema at all This is British comedy at its finest dark quirky and funny in ways that American films just never are I must stop short however of recommending this wholeheartedly to anyone I went to see it with several people some English some European and some American and while some of us loved it mainly from the first two groups some hated it and found it worthless If you think youre into this kind of thing then go If not dont 1010
0	I just saw Adam Had Four Sons for the first time and the thing that struck me was that I believe that the model used was Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons They were approximately the same ages as the four boys in this film Warner Baxter in his portrayal of Adam Stoddard talked about the same values and family tradition that you would have heard from our 26th president without some of the more boisterous aspects of TRs character br br Like TR all of the Stoddard sons serve in World War I in this case though the youngest only loses an eye instead of being killed br br But what if a female minx gets into this all male household and disrupts things Thats Susan Haywards job here In one of her earliest prominent roles Hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries one son has an affair with another and starts making a play for the third Its an early forerunner of the kind of a part that later brought her an Oscar in I Want to Livebr br I suppose that with as powerful a model of decorum as Theodore Roosevelt was and Warner Baxter portrays everyone is afraid to tell Father whats going on The sons and also their governess Ingrid Bergman Heres where the plot gets a little silly Bergman is introduced to us as a governess hired by Baxter and wife Fay Wray for their kids Wray dies and Baxter suffers some financial reversals in business Bergman has to be let go She goes back to France and years later comes back to the family when the kids are grown up br br Im sorry but I cant believe the kids need a governess now Hayward is quite right when she confronts her that it wasnt the kids who brought her back In the normal course of things Bergman would have gotten on with her life br br One of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the film I have was edited out Possibly that could be the reason for the many plot holes we havebr br Its too bad that Ingrid and Susan could not have done another film together in the Fifties when Hayward was at her heights and Bergman had just made a comebackbr br Susan Hayward is the main reason to see Adam Had Four Sons And Im willing to believe that a good deal of Ingrid was left on the cutting room floor
1	My former Cambridge contemporary Simon Heffer today a writer and journalist has put forward the theory that just as British filmmakers in the eighties were often critical of what they called Thatchers Britain the Ealing comedies were intended as satires on Attlees Britain the Britain which had come into being after the Labour victory in the 1945 general election This theory was presumably not intended to apply to say Kind Hearts and Coronets which is if anything a satire on the Edwardian upper classes or to The Ladykillers or The Lavender Hill Mob both of which may contain some satire but are not political in nature It can however be applied to most of the other films in the series especially Passport to Pimlicobr br Pimlico is or at least was in the forties a predominantly workingclass district of London set on the North Bank of the Thames about a mile from Victoria station It is not quite correct to say as has often been said that the film is about Pimlico declaring itself independent of Britain What happens is that an ancient charter comes to light proving that in the fifteenth century the area was ceded by King Edward IV to the Duchy of Burgundy This means that technically Pimlico is an independent state and has been for nearly five hundred years irrespective of the wishes of its inhabitants The government promise to pass a special Act of Parliament to rectify the anomaly but until the Act receives the Royal Assent the area remains outside the United Kingdom and British laws do not applybr br Because Pimlico is not subject to British law the landlord of the local pub is free to open whatever hours he chooses and local shopkeepers can sell whatever they please to whomever they please unhindered by the rationing laws When other traders start moving into the area to sell their goods in the streets the British authorities are horrified by what they regard as legalised blackmarketeering and seal off the area to try and force the Burgundians as the people of Pimlico have renamed themselves to surrenderbr br Many of the Ealing comedies have as their central theme the idea of the little man taking on the system either as an individual as happens in The Man in the White Suit or The Lavender Hill Mob or as part of a larger community as happens in Whisky Galore or The Titfield Thunderbolt The central theme of Passport is that of ordinary men and women taking on bureaucracy and governmentimposed regulations which seemed to be an increasingly important feature of life in the Britain of the forties The films particular target is the rationing system During the war the system had been accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against Nazism but it became increasingly politically controversial when the government tried to retain it in peacetime It was a major factor in the growing unpopularity of the Attlee administration which had been elected with a large majority in 1945 and organisations such as the British Housewives League were set up to campaign for the abolition of rationing I cannot agree with the reviewer who stated that the main targets of the films satire were the spivs black marketeers who play a relatively minor part in the action or the Housewives League who do not appear at all The satire is very much targeted at the bureaucrats who are portrayed either as having a rules for rules sake mentality or a desire to pass the buck and avoid having to take any action at allbr br I suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a different ending with Pimlico remaining independent as a British version of Monaco or San Marino Indeed I suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a TV sitcom rather than a film In 1949 however four years after the end of the war the filmmakers were keen stress patriotism and British identity so the film ends with Pimlico being reabsorbed into Britain One of the bestknown lines from the film is We always were English and we always will be English and its just because we ARE English that were sticking up for our right to be Burgundians There is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitude of officialdom with the common sense tolerance and good humour of the Cockneys of Pimlico all of which are presented as being quintessentially British characteristicsbr br Most of the action takes place during a summer drought and sweltering heatwave but in the last scene after Pimlico has rejoined the UK the temperature drops and it starts to pour with rain Global warming may have altered things slightly but for many years part of being British was the ability to hold the belief whatever statistics might say to the contrary that Britain had an abnormally wet climate The ability to make jokes about that climate was equally importantbr br There is a good performance from Stanley Holloway as Arthur Pemberton the grocer and smalltime local politician who becomes the Prime Minister of free Pimlico and an amusing cameo from Margaret Rutherford as a batty history professor In the main however this is appropriately enough for a film about a small community pulling together an example of ensemble acting with no real star performances but with everyone making a contribution to an excellent film It lacks the illwill and rancour of many more recent satirical films but its wit and satire are no less effective for all that It remains one of the funniest satires on bureaucracy ever made and with the possible exception of Kind Hearts and Coronets is my personal favourite among the Ealing comedies 1010
1	Heres another movie that should be loaded into a satellite fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy Andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity This movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a ripoff of the already bad movie classic KING KONG from 1976 that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness but successfully predicted much of Peter Jacksons miserable 2005 computer cartoon bearing the same name as far as a romance between the giant here a Yeti and a gorgeous human female Antonellina Interlenghi of Umberto Lenzis CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD who is very easy on the eyesbr br The film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex the Yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness But as a tradeoff you DO get a wacky old scientist two inquisitive kids Tony Kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure Dog Adventure movies were big in Europe for a while and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the Yeti who turns out to be the good guy glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands a monster whos size literally changes scale from shot to shot some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in GODZILLA VS THE SMOG MONSTER look tame by comparison crowd reaction shots aplenty made up of either Spanish Italian or Canadian extras depending upon scene you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey moviebr br Its here that the film won me over Its enthusiasm just for being made Frank Kramer is actually the same Gianfranco Parolini who brought the world SARTANA in 1968 and GODS GUN the year before this was a very important director in the Spaghetti Western and actionadventure genre film scene from the 1960s1970s and by the time of YETI he was probably delighted to get the work I would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever or rather the one he took the most chances with and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids families The movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless Or rather they are part of the fun and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldnt have worked WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY PETER JACKSONS MOVIE SUCKED br br He forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid Power Macintosh pod people animators and with all its faults clunkiness Kramers YETI is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space Id rank this up there with KING KONG VERSUS GODZILLA and IT CURSE OF THE GREAT GOLEM as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever Because the movie looks so fake you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked trampled tossed about and smashed Knowing that and armed with a fertile energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie Parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie I will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend This is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloidbr br 1010 its about ten minutes too long but who cares you only come around once and Id rather go out with a smile on my face

1	Norman Is That You was this is all third hand so take it with a grain of salt adapted to an African American family from a Jewish one when it made the transition off stage and onto screen Also it was one of those movies originally filmed in video so the prints from the theater cant have been that great Still performances by Redd Foxx and others were pretty good br br What I wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a PERIOD PIECE it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early 70s about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family For that reason alone its pretty interesting if not a little hollywood Dont believe me Check out lines about curtains etc Very stereotypical Not too deepbr br But the movie really shines in a couple of areas There is a side splitting scene when Redd Foxx is trying to find his wife whos run away with his brother to Ensenada in a souped up Pinto The phone conversation across the border is really memorable br br But the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did histheir gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs To the best of my knowledge this is the only time that routine was filmed And its a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version Im told Still its vintage Madame and shouldnt be missed People are still stealing lines from Wayland the man was truly gifted Enjoy the movie
0	A very weak movie mainly because of a poor story but also poor acting in the case of Robert Downey Jr and irrational behaviour by many of the characters If you are someone who likes to switch your mind off and simply watch a movie for its creativity or acting criteria then you may like this movie Personally I cant do that with a drama and found this too farfetchedbr br Im particularly annoyed when a main character that is supposed to be an intelligent person continually acts like a complete imbecile In this movie if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations there would be no moviebr br The first highly unlikely act is when the main character a successful attorney named Magruder played by Kenneth Branagh is leaving a party and happens upon a girl Mallory Doss played by Embeth Davidtz who is screaming that her car has been stolen They are standing around in a tropical rainstorm as he badgers her into accepting a ride homebr br She tells him about her weird father who belongs to some kind of weird sect and does crazy things When they arrive at her dilapidated shack in the poorer part of town they notice that her car is in the driveway Also the house lights are on and some objects in the house have been brokenbr br Things are very odd shes weird looking like a tramp she undresses in front of him until shes completely naked oh yeah Also the fathers strange the house is a wreck everything should have told Magruder hey this is too weird for me Im out of here But not Magruder he sleeps with her and then motivated by her story and sex takes up the case of trying to have her father committed It all screams setupbr br Then being the topflight attorney that he is he arrives late at the office wearing the same shirt he had on the night before a fact that all of the women in the office notice Is it likely that a successful attorney would act like a 16yearold Magruder has upset the police in some of his cases so when he goes to the police claiming with ample evidence that the father is terrorising them the police ignore him I could have believed begrudging assistance But no help at all not likelybr br Its just too unlikely

0	The Curse of Frankenstein sticks faithfully to Mary Shelleys story for one word of the title which wouldnt be so bad if the changes were any good at all The tragedy of the creature destroying Frankensteins family has been completely excised and replaced with nothing The heart and moral centre of the story is gone It doesnt help that this Frankenstein is a conniving devious murderer he deserves everything he gets The plot is basically a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clichés Even taken on its own terms this is rubbish a bland rambling film featuring a shitelooking creature with a pudding bowl haircut As its the first of Hammers horror films directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee its place in horror history is secure But its crap

1	Well I guess Im emotionally attached to this movie since its the first one I went to see more than 10 times in the cinema helping me through my masters thesis or rather keeping me from working on itbr br But on watching it again several years and many many movies later what a wellcrafted little gem this is Ive never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a more convincing performance and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr Knightley where does one meet such a man sigh Sophie Thompsons turn as Ms Bates is virtuoso acting of the finest oh napkins sorry and the rest of the cast is no disappointment either Toni Colette brings a lot of Muriel to her Harriet and Ewan McGregor is convincingly charming and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are the perfect impossible couplebr br Of course the sets and costumes and the beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the feelgood almost Hobbitonlike atmosphere of the movie although as far as cinematography and art decoration go its almost a case of visual overload Very very pretty but a little more austerity might have conveyed a better sense of period But the good thing is the movie doesnt take itself too seriously and there is plenty of fun and some pretty cool editing that keep it from sinking into saccharine Merry Old England modebr br My particular favorite is the ball scene some beautiful acting and directing here and the concluding dance summarizes the relationship between Emma and Mr Knightley just beautifully Pity that the final proposal scene goes on for just a little too long cut two shots I can think of exactly which ones and it would have been much more in keeping with the rest of the moviebr br Gosh I just realize by reading the imdb listings that Ive seen Jeremy Northam in at least three movies without even being aware that it was him seems hes got a lot more going for him as an actor than just being a gentlemanlike English heartthrob Hmm guess I need to pay my video store a visitbr br Lovely movie My favorite Jane Austen adaptation so far though perhaps Ang Lees Sense and Sensibility is strictly speaking the better movie this one is closest to my heart and Ive certainly seen it many more times Watch it if you can and dont be too hard on its little imperfectionsbr br

0	but a lousy film As Maltin says this was Christopher Lees attempt to make a serious horror film Well it is seriousTOO serious The plot is silly and slow something about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortalitythe film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again I actually dozed off a few times The film is sooooo dull The cast sleepwalks through this with the sole exceptions of Peter Cushing and Leebut this was probably a labor of love for both they often complained about horror movies being too violentwell this has NO violence Avoid at all costsunless you have insomniathis will put you to sleep
0	This is another of the many B minus movies tagged as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it All aspects of the film script acting direction are mediocre The acting by the three leads is wooden I guess John Dall was expected to go places in the movie business but then someone realised he had little talent and therefore ended up doing TV work Lee J Cobb who is usually terrific cannot rise above the poor script and poor direction Jane Wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatale but comes nowhere near convincing the viewers The movie does have two of the strangest looking cars that I have ever seen the one in which John Dall goes after Lee J Cobb is particularly strange The DVD transfer is typical Alpha
0	I couldnt watch more than 14 minutes of it Its a GREAT combination of really bad acting and really bad directing The shots used are disgusting they broke the 180 degrees angle all the time My head hurts try to watch that load of you know what Dirt on the mystery machine window make you see light from the lighting on the windowsannoying What else its so badly framed all the time its just make you want to scream at that lady directing there I only directed short films but Im pretty sure Id be way better than that directing a feature film the story is unbelievable just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that its gonna be pretty awful So pretty much try to avoid this really bad movies at all cost itll save you the 5 bucks or so for the rental and that 1h30 hour of your life youll never get back

0	If there was ever a call to make a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could become this one would take the prize The plot centers around bible prophecies that lie in hidden messages of the scriptures that prompt a group of powerseeking thugs to attempt total control of the world Just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be br br The acting was bad at best Casper Van Dien wasted his talent doing this film Michael Yorks work was a fair match for the role since he was the center of the film and did a good job br br This plot was sickening and very disturbing No tender or immature minds should see this film This is how a basic good vs evil plot can go astraybr br There must be a lot of mental disease floating around the film circles who look for ways to market this type of junk There must have been something censored out to get a PG13 rating but it was still awful

0	I was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent Indian Candians but i found this show to be not funny at all The producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned its getting talked about I was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason they are usually true But there really wasnt anything funny about these stereotypical characters The fresh of the boat dad who doesnt understand his daughter The radical feminist Muslim daughter who by the way is a terrible actress and the young modern Indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can hes a pretty good actor i only see him getting betterbr br it is very contrived and the dialog doesnt flow that well there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed and dont really care to watch another episodebr br I did however enjoy watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again shes always a treat and a natural at everything she does too bad her daughter in the show doesnt have the same acting abilities
1	Watch On The Rhine started as a Broadway play by Lillian Hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still bound to Nazi Germany by that infamous nonaggression pact signed in August of 1939 So much for the fact that Hellman was merely echoing the Communist party line the line didnt change until a couple of months later Lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this workbr br The play Watch On The Rhine ran from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from Broadway to repeat their roles Frank Wilson as the butler Eric Roberts as the youngest son Lucile Watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukasbr br Lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an Oscar a Golden Globe and the New York Film Critics for Best Actor Probably if the Tony Awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well The Oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca Gary Cooper in For Whom The Bell Tolls Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie Every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was Lukass nomination is usually the kind the Academy gives to round out a fieldbr br Jack Warner knew that which is why Mady Christians did not repeat her Broadway part and the role of Lukass wife was given to Bette Davis Davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it Its the same reason she did The Man Who Came To Dinner a much lighter play than this onebr br Davis is the daughter of a late American Supreme Court Justice who married a German national back in the Weimar days After many years of being vagabonds on the continent of Europe Davis Lukas and their three children come to America which has not yet entered the European War Theyre made welcome by Lucile Watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildrenbr br The fly in this ointment are some other house guests a friend of Daviss from bygone days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who is also from Europe a Rumanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris Coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects Lukass antifascist background br br His suspicions are quite correct its the reason that the family has been the vagabonds theyve become Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there His health has not been the same since His family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes Those decisions affect all the other members of the castbr br Adding quite a bit more to the Broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was Dashiell Hammett who was Lillian Hellmans significant other Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy was a Hammett creation with such loathsome types as Henry Daniell Kurt Katch Clyde Fillmore Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Andersbr br Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account Runmanian count He was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the Nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after Stalingradbr br Lucile Watson was up for Best Supporting Actress in 1943 but lost to Katina Paxinou in For Whom The Bell Tolls Dashiell Hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for Best Picture to that other antifascist classic Casablanca br br Though its an item firmly planted in those specific times Watch On The Rhine still packs a stern antifascist message that bears repeating infinitely
0	Well they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied I dont know if Stella James Sean Young qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men Shes still exploring trying to find more data so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now I cant agree however with anyone who says Young is too old for the role If she is we should all age so nicely For the most part this film left me cold though its by no means the worst of its type youll ever see And unlike the recent Eyes Wide Shut at least something happens in this one

1	This movie isnt as bad as I heard It was enjoyable funny and I love that is revolves around the holiday season It totally has me in the mood to Christmas shop and listen to holiday music When this movie comes out on DVD it will take the place of Christmas Vacation in my collection It will be a movie to watch every year after Thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year I heard that Bens character was a bit crazy but I think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time Take it for what is it a Christmas comedy with a love twist I enjoyed it No it isnt Titanic and it wont make your heart pound with anticipation but it will bring on a laugh or two So go laugh and have a good time

1	You know Robin Williams God bless him is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade with perhaps the exception of Death To Smoochy which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic The dramas he has made lately have been fantastic especially Insomnia and One Hour Photo The Night Listener despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release is among his best work periodbr br This is a very chilling story even though it doesnt include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter The concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed In high school I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted AIDS as a result I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist When I saw this movie the confused feelings that Robin Williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mindbr br Toni Collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like Little Miss Sunshine There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me It takes a good actress to play that sort of role and its this understated yet well reviewed role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an Academy Award as of 2008 Its incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this and its scary toobr br This is a good dark film that I highly recommend Be prepared to be unsettled though because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end

1	Whats inexplicable Firstly the hatred towards this movie It may not be the greatest movie of all time but gimme a break it got 11 oscars for a reason it made EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS for a reason Its a damn good movie Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it I have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when I saw it in theaters Ive rewatched it on TV and video and it had none of the impact it had when I saw it on the big screen twice or maybe three times actually But that might be it the appeal of it Its a Movie yes capital M there its an Epic its a spectacle in the order of Gone With the Wind or Ben Hur Now Ben Hur and Gone With the Wind seem kinda hokey to me with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama Not that Titanic has none of that Well the acting was actually very good The melodrama was quite heavyhanded at timesbr br But the reason Titanic works is that its such an emotional ride I usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind or give me a visual thrill This movie isnt exactly dumb but its not cerebral at all The visual thrills are simply means to an end to fuel the emotions of the audience I didnt cry when Bambis mom died I dont react to tearjerkers But this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million an emotional rollercoaster that if it were a regular one would make Buzz Aldrin scream like a little girl And Im sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it and have a ready supply of cynicism then you can thoroughly dislike this movie But if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt youll enjoy it completely And look at the top ten grossing films of all time Is a single one of them bad Is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10 No not even The Phantom Menace And this movie made 18 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide It cant be bad Not possible 1010br br ps how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman spiderman was a fun movie but it was a total 911 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did it simply wasnt anything all that special no one will remember it in 50 years but im pretty sure Titanic will be remembered

1	While not as wild and way out as some of Takashi Miikes later films this is a very good crime drama br br The basic story is the story of a cop of Japanese cop with Chinese parents trying to take down an up and coming Chinese mobster Complicating things is that his younger brother is acting as the lawyer for the villain and his gang The film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications which both keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust Its this complication and loss of way about an hour into the film that makes this less than a great filmIt is a very very good one This is definitely worth seeing especially if you dont mind a no frantic pacebr br A word of warning the violence when it happens is explosive and nasty There are also semigraphic depictions of gay sex If thats not your cup of tea proceed with cautionbr br 7 or 8 out of 10
1	A fantastic Arabian adventure A former king Ahmad and his best friend the thief Abu played by Sabu of Black Narcissus search for Ahmads love interest who has been stolen by the new king Jaffar Conrad Veidt Theres hardly a down moment here Its always inventing new adventures for the heroes Personally I found Ahmad and his princess a little boring theres no need to ask why John Justin who plays Ahmad is listed fourth in the credits Conrad Veidt always a fun actor makes a great villain and Sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves who at one point finds a genie in a bottle I also really loved Miles Malleson as the Sultan of Basra the father of the princess He collects amazing toys from around the world Jaffar bribes him for his daughters hand with a mechanical flying horse This probably would count as one of the great childrens films of all time but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays Kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when Abu and the genie are on screen together And the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful Although most of the younger generation probably thinks that King Kong looks bad at this point in time Willis OBriens stopmotion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesnt even look remotely like a spider 810

1	If you like Deep Purple you will enjoy in this excellent movie with Stephen Rea in main role The story is about the most famous rock group back there in 70s Strange Fruits and they decided to play together again But of course there is going to be lots of problem during theirs concerts Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great and song The Flame Still Burns is perfect You have to watch it
1	A very funny movie It was good to see Jim Carrey back in top form It was definitely worth the price of admission Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film I think they may have played the dog a bit too much however still a good film to see
1	This whimsical film had the misfortune of being released at the same time of the highly popular Amelie both having the wonderful Audrey Tautou playing the central role Laurent Firode the talented director made one of the most enjoyable films that have come out of France in recent memorybr br The film deals with chance as its English title indicates The French title makes reference at how butterflies wings can create chaos over the Atlantic as they fly as well as hurricanes in the Pacific something not to be believed just by looking at these colorful insects From the start the director interlaces all the characters one sees in the film and how each has a connection to the other something that is hard to imagine but in the films context seems to work wellbr br A chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film Irene who is going to work is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her Zodiac sign is and proceeds to read from her paper Irene it seems will cross paths and will find her soul mate that same day After Irene leaves the train the quiet young man seated next to the woman tells her he has the same birth date as Irene It seems they are destined to one another from the start but alas they will not reconnect until the last frame of the filmbr br Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Irene Faudel who plays Younes doesnt have a lot to do until the end but he shows he has a presence and plays well his part The talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film which is as light as butterfly wingsbr br We look forward to future films by Laurent Firode because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected
0	This movie has successfully proved what we all already know that professional basketball players suck at everything besides playing basketball Especially rapping and acting I can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is First of all is it just me or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen I mean his teeth could be used as a canopener Secondly why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when even though he has magical powers he sucks horribly at making music Third I have read the Bible In no way shape or form did it say that Jesus made genies Fourth what was the deal with all the crappy special effects I assure you that any acneaddled nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that Fifth why did the ending suck so badly And what the hell is a djin And finally whoever created the nightmare known as Kazaam needs to be thrown off of a plane and onto the Eiffel Tower because this movie take the word suck to an entirely new level
1	When I think of the cheesiest guilty pleasuretype movies the first thing I think of are 80s slasher flicks Really bad slasher flicks The formulaic type of film where all a script needed was 2 parts blood and several parts nudity to get madebr br Flash forward to the late 90searly 00s The slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of 1996s Scream Like in the 80s these films were formulaic masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as hip tongueincheek parodies of the original slasher flicks Of this recent blend of hip parody neoslasher flicks the only one worth seeing is the lowbudget directtovideo Cutbr br Like most of the other new slasher flicks Cut relies on the production of a slasher flick in this case a fictional 1985 film Hot Blooded to make its commentary on the genre Hot Blooded never finished production because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the films killer Scarman a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark pupilless eyes Now 12 years later a group of film students whose professor was involved in the production have decided to go into the vaults tap the original surviving actress and finish the film But every time the film is screened or a scene is shot Scarman returns and someone dies To quote the tagline will they finish the film before it finishes thembr br This all sounds really bad and to a degree it is really is there such a thing as a good slasher flick There is no character development the new director is revealed to be the daughter of Hot Bloodeds original director whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled this wouldve been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot yet its never mentioned again and like in all other slasher flicks there are just too many bodies to care about The actors arent great even by directtovideo standards but most are having fun with their characters and for those who arent its inadvertent character acting since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on Hot Blooded particularly whoever was lucky enough to play Scarman Cuts climax has no big who dunnit unmasking of the killer like in the Scream films It doesnt have the gimmick killings of the Urban Legend films What it does have is an original and interesting concept that is diluted by a this way we can write a sequel if it sells well ending But thats par for the coursebr br By any sensible viewing standards this is a horrible movie that should be avoided but this quality is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neoslasher flicks
0	Magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming shrieking overwrought hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret guilt and pain PT Anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong messbr br A look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent and they were I just wish that every scene didnt involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have causedbr br I also think that Anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film The opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at But the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display I kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution Throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of Anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the Old Testamentbr br I will say that the music by Aimee Mann was great and Ill be looking for the Soundtrack CD In short a good movie to look at and listen to the music that is if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been

1	This is one of the most guilty pleasure movies everbr br I am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is TISH but still enjoy watching her make her space outfit like super cool with a like totally bitchin belt and stick on rhinestones on her facebr br But anyways the movie is actually one of the few family movies that holds your interest I know that the begining drags particuarly if you know what is going to happen but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking segments in a family filmbr br I wouldnt stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself but Ill admit it here with the internet to hide behindbr br
0	I wasnt expecting this to be a great movie but neither was I expecting it to be so awful I hated the mother character so much I had to turn the channel I turned it back hoping it was just one part of the movie but no And for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed or almost done out of a job or driven to madness inside her own home Are you kidding me I was raised to respect and even fear my mother but Id put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in MY house I was expected to follow a set of rules in my mothers house after allbr br I didnt buy any of it I tried giving it several chances I really did Sorry
1	A very early Oliver Stone associateproduced film and one of the first films in the impressive career of Lloyd Kaufman cofounder and president of the worlds only real independent film studio Troma creator of the Toxic Avenger and at the prestigious Amsterdam Fantastic Filmfestival lifetimeachievement awarded filmmaker for over 30 years Having raised the money for this film on his own Lloyd wrote this script together with Theodore Gershuni in 1970 and in hindsight regrets having listened to advice to have Gershuni else direct the film instead of doing it himself But back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore Indeed it would have been interesting to see Lloyds version of his own script as one of the worlds most original daring experimental and noncompromising directors he probably would have given it even more edge than it already has But as it is we have the Gershunidirected film And weather it is due to the strong script or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own SUGAR COOKIES is a very intelligent highly suspenseful and wellcrafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives The shoestring budget the small studio this was even before Kaufman and his friend and partner for over 30 years now Michael Herz formed Troma had to work with is so well handled that the film looks a lot more expensive indeed does not have a low budget look at all The story revolves around lesbian Camilla Stone played by enigmatic Mary Woronow and her lover who winds up dead through circumstances I wont reveal not to spoil a delightful story This leads to a succession of plottwists mind games and personality reform that is loosely inspired by Hitchcocks Vertigo and at least as inventive The atmosphere is a lot grimmer though and some comparisons to Nicholas Roegs and Donald Cammells PERFORMANCE come to mind In this mix is a very original and inventive erotic laden thriller that keeps it quite unclear as to how it is all going to end which along with a splendidly interwoven subplot with a nod to Kaufmans earlier and unfortunately unavailable BIG GUSS WHATS THE FUSS makes for a very exciting oneandahalfhour Certainly one of the best films in Tromas library and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their catalog is one of bad taste The DVD includes some recent interviews Kaufman conducts with Woronov and the other leading lady Lynn Lowry later seen in George Romeros THE CRAZIES thus giving some interesting insight in what went on during the making of this cultfavorite and a few hints of what would be different had Lloyd directed it himself Highly recommended
1	Romance is in the air and love is in bloom in Victorian era England in this lighthearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue the ladies were charming and elegant and the gentlemen dashing Emma based on the novel by Jane Austen and written for the screen and directed by Douglas McGrath stars the lovely Gwyneth Paltrow in the title role A selfappointed matchmaker Emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing Cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another Coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend Harriet Toni Collette but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying Meanwhile her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome Mr Knightley Jeremy Northam whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than Emmas and lend some needed balance to the proceedings And Emma so concerned with what is right for others neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all Her own The world goes round and love abounds but Emma is about to miss the boat Luckily for her however the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings Now if she can but stop long enough to realize it But as everyone who has known true love knows matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant depending upon the slightest thing and while romance is at hand for Emma she must first recognize it and seize the momentbr br McGrath has crafted and delivered a delightful feelgood film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world There may be an air of frivolity about it but in retrospect this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is in all honesty to just about anyone Love And with McGraths impeccable sense of pace and timing it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable Its a pleasant affecting film with a wonderful cast that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place Its light fare but absorbing and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of wellbeing and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flowbr br The winsome Paltrow who won the Oscar for best actress for Shakespeare In Love two years after making this one seems comfortable and right at home in this genre She personifies all things British and does it with such naturalness and facility that its the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether Shes simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy She has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner very reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn Yet Paltrow is unique As an actor she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated with such films as Hard Eight Hush and A Perfect Murder that she can play just about any part effectively and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own But its with characters like Emma that she really shines She is so expressive and open and her personality is so engaging that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch regardless of the part she is playing And for Emma she is absolutely perfectbr br Jeremy Northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of Knightley and like Paltrow seems suited to the genre in the right role that is his performance in the more recent The Golden Bowl in which he played an Italian Prince was less than satisfying Here however he is perfect he is handsome and carries himself in such a way that makes Knightley believable and very real Like Colin Firths Mr Darcy in the miniseries Pride and Prejudice Northam has created a memorable character with his own Mr Knightleybr br Also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are Toni Collette as Emmas friend Harriet Smith and Alan Cumming as the Reverend Elton Respectively Collette and Cumming create characters who are very real people and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film And it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema and to films of any genrebr br The supporting cast includes Greta Scacchi Mrs Weston Denys Hawthorne Mr Woodhouse Sophie Thompson Miss Bates Kathleen Byron Mrs Goddard Phyllida Law Mrs Bates Polly Walker Jane Fairfax and Ewan McGregor Frank Churchill An uplifting elegant film Emma is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness And even if its only through the magic of the silver screen its nice to be able to escape to such a world as this if only for a couple of hours as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit And thats the magic of the movies I rate this one 910 br br br br
1	This was a superb episode one of the best of both seasons Down right horror for a change with a story that is way way above the average MOH episodes if there is such a thing A mans wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck in which he was driving His airbag worked hers didnt She is burned beyond recognition great makeup btw and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft BUT even in a coma she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology and when she does die for a few minutes her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit Carnage of course ensues and also some extremely gory killings and also some extremely sexy scenes What more could you ask for you might ask Well not much because this baby has it all and a very satirical ending that should leave a smile on most viewers faces I just loved Rob Schmidts Wrong Turn direction too he has a great knack for horror Excellent episode this is one Im buying for sure
0	When I tell people that I review movies as a hobby the first thing they say is What do you think of suchandsuch movie There are a couple of problems here Firstly there is the probable chance that Ive not seen it and thus I ruin my reputation Secondly I could trash the movie in question without realising that its actually their favourite Lastly I could be given DVDs to watch so they can judge my opinion Thus I find myself sat before The Convent which is the sort of film I would ignore completely given the choice but unable to avoid here Mores the pity because this frankly dreadful horror is about as scary as a box of kittensbr br Following wellworn clichés The Convent focuses on a bunch of American high school students on a trip to an abandoned convent on a mission to get stoned laid and mildly spooked But youll never guess what happens next A group of cannibalistic demonic nuns emerge from the cobwebs who proceed to pick the kids off one by one in classic horror movie tradition Will any of them survive and more importantly havent you got better things to worry about br br The only thing that saves The Convent from being a total waste of time is the fact that nobody is really taking this tosh seriously with the exception of Coolios bizarre cameo as a hyperactive cop with an itchy trigger finger Its far too amusing to be properly frightening the zombie cheerleader who makes chipmunk noises for no reason the dayglo paint jobs that appears when you become a zombie but what really kills it as a horror is the fact that you can instantly tell when someone is going to jump out and get messily murdered But even if they were trying I still doubt that it would work demonic nuns wearing the sort of makeup youd see in the Buffy The Vampire Slayer TV show arent really that scary The scariest thing about this movie really is that over 10 of voters gave this a maximum score I mean I know its funny but I hardly split my sides To be honest Ive had more fun in a dentistbr br The Convent isnt really a horror movie as such Its more of a comedy horror like Scary Movie or Shaun Of The Dead but youre laughing at it instead of with it I honestly cant recommend this to anybody except the family of the cast and crew but even then I doubt very much theyd enjoy it I dont enjoy the so bad that its good genre I personally feel that if the filmmakers cant be bothered to salvage a turkey then I shouldnt bust a gut trying to watch it Yes its a bad film and yes they really should have gone home and done something more constructive A Rubiks cube for example The DVD box has two price stickers one for £499 and a reduced price of £3 But it was sold for £1 and that should tell you everything you need to know about this poxy cheap awesomely bad flick Sorry if you do like it but The Convent really is a pile of unholy crap
1	The critics didnt like this film It bombed in the States and as a result received only a limited showing in Britain Which was a great shame because it represents British rather than American humour and should have been shown in Britain firstbr br Nicole Kidman looks stunning and is a totally convincing Russian Ben Chaplin is the Dustin Hoffman character from The Graduate and Birthday Girl has at least 4 scenes which remind the viewer of that 1960s classic despite being a totally different storybr br Sure it changes tack a number of times from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure but its memorable moving and a weclome breath of fresh air compared to the average megabudget blockbusterbr br See it with an open mind

0	This Hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale A young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy They spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence However after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence However out of no where when they are on a luxury cruise the ship sinks and they lose everythingand end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life What an odd silly and preachy film Personally Id like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserablebr br The production values are relatively poor compared to later productionsa rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting
1	i would like to comment the series as a great effort The story line although requiring a few improvements was pretty well especially in season 1 Season 2 however became more of a freak show and lost DAs original charm Season one story line was more interesting a light side to the life at Jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the Xseries i was looking forward to new seasons in fact i still am I hope the FOX guys and DA production crew realize that a lot of ppl still wait for DA to make a comeback Even after 2 yrs of it being cancelled DA can make it big if worked on properly and i think a name like James Cameron should take on this challenge
1	I saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary What I love most about it is that it is understated and lowkey but deeply heartfelt Henry Thomas he played the child in ET performance is masterfully inarticulate he is supposed to be a man of few words David Straithern is a wonderful crazy villain And miraculously given that were talking about a Hollywood product here a baby serves as a main character but one who doesnt act or have lines but rather just IS is luminous at that Interesting to note that Thomas mysterious relationship w ET was the core of that film while his bond w the baby serves as the core of A Good Babybr br Then there is the musicah what music Gillian Welchs tunes are wonderful the entire score is gorgeous hill country musicbr br This film is wonderfully atmospheric I recommend it highly
0	Now Ill be the first to admit it when I say something that may be blasphemous or unfair so I would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much I disliked this moviebr br That about sums it up too I disliked this movie To be more specific I disliked the concept of this movie The cinematography was good The mood was nice And the acting was satisfactorybr br However the story is fatuous unacurate and misleading It is also offensivebr br I am a quarter Cree Indian and for some reason I feel insulted on a personal level by the nature of Whitakers character First of all hes a black guy And this isnt a racist remark I swear The thought of a White Hispanic or even Native American swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents The katana represents the soul of a Samurai imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the Samurai For Ghost Dog to use his guns instead of the Katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside and where the heck did he get a Katana anyway It must be one of those replicas which insults the Samurai caste even morebr br Also Ghost Dog showed no honor Near the end of the movie he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain Not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy its more like a ninjas way silent assassins a group that samurais deny exists but hates nonethelessbr br Then he tries to kill his boss when he finds out his boss is a baddie You know what a true Samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable He kills himself to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish masterbr br Everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all Samurai adhere to Bushidobr br So we have great cinematography good ambiance and soso acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it making it an unsatisfactory overall film and an insult to everything a honorable bushisamurai holds dearbr br 2510 Bleah
0	This movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning but never fleshed out to its expectations The director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas typical of the Asian directors but doesnt know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it The story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film never finding a solid explainable interesting angle Basically the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases The acting was very good however All the actors gave good performances and Jude Law was outstanding as he is always is It is too bad he chose to do such a weak film
0	From director Barbet Schroder Reversal of Fortune I think I saw a bit of this in my Media Studies class and I recognised the leading actress so I tried it despite the rating by the critics Basically cool kid Richard Haywood Half Nelsons Ryan Gosling and Justin Pendleton Bullys Michael Pitt team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them Investigating the murder is homicide detective Cassie The Hyena Mayweather Sandra Bullock with new partner Sam Kennedy Ben Chaplin who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene eg nonrelating hairs The plan doesnt seem to be completely going well because Cassie and Sam do quite quickly have Richard or Justin as suspects it is just a question of if they can sway them away Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills Chris Penn as Ray Feathers RD Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst DA Al Swanson I can see now the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcocks Rope with the murdering for a challenge thing but this film does it in a very silly way and not even a reasonably good Bullock can save it from being dull and predictable Adequate

1	all the acting done in the first season has been really amazing the first look you get of Max and Zach is through Geneva Locke and Chris Lazar or as i like to call them the minis the minis do the best acting job that i have ever seen kids do the main actors and actresses ie Jessica Alba Michael Weatherly etc make you forget you are watching a fictional tv show they seem to make this show come alive all in all this is the best show i have ever watched

1	Platos run is an entertaining b movie with Gary Buseyit is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right toGary Busey plays Plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful Cuban crime lord now on the run Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by Steve Bauer scarface and action star Jeff Speaksman the expert what i liked about Platos run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax Gary Busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and Steve Bauer is good as Platos sidekick even Jeff Speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of Platos run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 7 out of 10

0	I went to see the Omega Code with a group of other Christians totaling about 15 people We all expected a good piece of Christian filmmaking What we got was an excruciatingly painful drawnout and pretty boring attempt at a film It has good looking production values but also has poor acting a weak script with lousy dialogue and no real sense of direction From the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night We all hated it and some people in our group placed this movie as reeking of more cheese than Anaconda None of us could believe that the movie lasted less than 2 hours Flashy effects and crisp looking cinematography cant save this bad bad movie Id give it a 3 out of 10 and the rating is only that high because I rented the abominable movie Werewolf 1996 the night before I saw this movie
1	Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell costar in The Amazing Mr Williams a 1939 mysterycomedy thats quite good although forgotten probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in 1939br br Douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed What happens in this film is no exception hes called to a murder scene just as hes about to walk down the aisle yet againbr br Both stars were excellent at comedy worked together well and often and help make this battle of the sexes fun Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are on hand for excellent supportbr br As you can read in other reviews Melvyn Douglas doesnt make much of a womanbr br Entertaining if a little on the long sidebr br One of the comments here trashed Melvyn Douglas one of our greatest actors He literally floated effortlessly through dozens of films as the other man and the best friend before coming into his own in films as an old man He wasnt lazy but rather a very hardworking actor who made it look easy who had a Broadway career simultaneously with his film career He just wasnt cast as a leading man in films or given very challenging roles under the studio system I challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in Hud and I Never Sang for my Father and call him lazy or make reference to his smirk
0	I have read the whole A wrinkle in time book and then saw the movie The movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was 190 pages and the film was 2 hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad actingbr br A wrinkle in time is about a girl named Meg Charles Wallace and Calvin must team together to find Megs father and get off the island Camazotz br br The beginning of the film is really a stinker The acting is awful the direction is laughable and so far the situations arent necessary I really was crushed to see the same person Madeleine Engle that wrote the book and created the movie made a great book and a terrible film The acting is worse than any straighttovideo acting Yes I got to admit there was cool effects But seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible If you read the book you will be crushed by the movie I wish could give it a 0 but sadly I can only give it 1 A half could have been useful
0	How many more of those fake slice of life movies need to be made Hopefully not too manybr br Raising Victor Vargas is a very selfconscious attempt by the director Peter Solett at garnering the attention of Hollywood Nothing wrong with that in general What is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every cliché in the book of supposedly edgy Hollywood independent productionbr br Its supposed to be real so left shake the camera documentary style except no documentarian would shake the camera on purposebr br Its edgy so lets not waste any time lighting the filmbr br Its hip so lets have the children use swear words like Al Pacino in Scarfacebr br And so on and so forth All that you are left with is a very selfconscious attempt at impressing Hollywood that wont impress anyone outside of the rarefied indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film
1	First off I must say that I made the mistake of watching the Election films out of sequence I say unfortunately because after seeing Election 2 first Election seems a bit of a disappointment Both films are gangster epics that are similar in form And while Election is an enjoyable piece of cinema its just not nearly as good as its sequelbr br In the first Election installment we are shown the two competitors for Chairman Big D and Lok After a few scenes of discussion amongst the Uncles as to who should have the Chairman title they almost unanimously decide That Lok Simon Yam will helm the Triads Suffice to say this doesnt go over very well with competitor Big D Tony Leung Ka Fai and in a bid to influence the takeover Big D kidnaps two of the uncles in order to sway the election board to his side This has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war Lok is determined to become Chairman but wont become official until he can recover the Dragon Head Baton a material representation of the Chairmans power The current Chairman Whistle Chung Wang has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland China and the race is on to see who can recover it firstbr br Much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the Baton As both aspiring leaders search for it they must dodge cops and opposite sides which leads into one of the stand out scenes in Election which involves an underling named Jet Nick Cheung a machete and lots of bad guys Nick Cheungs presence is attention grabbing to say the least I wonder if this influenced director Johhnie To in any way while making the second Election as he does deliver more of Jets character in the sequelbr br While Nick Cheung gives a scene stealing performance I must not fail to give due to the rest of the films actors Election has a great ensemble cast with well thought out performances that are both subtle and impacting Simon Yam is his usually glorious self and the film also benefits from heavyweight HK actors like Louis Koo Tony Leung Ka Fai and the underappreciated Suet Lam There really arent any weak links in the acting and one could easily believe that theyre watching real gangstersbr br Although the performances are great one of the most impressive things about Election is Johnnie Tos eye for the camera There are some truly striking shots in the film and it goes without saying that To definitely knows how to frame his shots as the viewer is treated to a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera placings and angles All of which makes Election above all a great looking filmbr br My issues with the film arises mostly out of the shear amount of characters involved in Election It gets a bit hard to follow because the film is so full of characters that arent integral to the plot While the sequel opts to focus more on the two candidates the first Election offers the election process as a whole with tons of Uncles underlings and police officers crowding the storyline Maybe the film would have worked better if it would have been a bit longer with more time dedicated to the inner workings of the Triad or if Director Johnnie To would have funneled down the necessary elements and expounded on them more br br Bottom Line All in all this is a wonderfully brutal film with a great cast excellent direction and leisurely pacing that packs a punch Its just a little more complicated than it needed to be
1	I didnt really know what to expect when going out to watch the film apart from the slightly surreal basic plotline that a lonely man orders a Russian bride over the internet That and it had Nicole Kidman in it I absolutely loved the film though and came out thinking wowbr br Refreshingly down to earth the film moves along nicely with a few suprises at each corner The relationships in the film are believeable with Nicole and Chaplin working against each other beautifully The humour is subtle with some great Officelike scenes at the bank and the thriller element add tension without being Hollywoodbr br Overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation Its less about heroics and more about delicate relationships Britfilmmaking at its bestbr br 910
1	I have to start saying it has been a long time since I have seen it but have seen it 5 or more times a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musicalcomedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence Kay Kysers mysteries would be a good examplebr br Having Spike Jones unleashed is the best part of the show as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action doing a fine job of support Hugh OBrien plays the face Buddy Hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to Lou Costello and thus Abbott and Costello replacing the leads Dont know if that was truebr br all in all a pleasant movie but important to have that much Spike Jones and his band on film for history Wish that it was released as I havent seen or heard of it now in two decades Hope it is not lost
0	Sorry everyone I know this is supposed to be an art film but wow they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch Although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent this story is too painful to watch The absence of a sound track was brutal The loooonnnnng shots were too long How long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking Especially when the dialogue is two people complaining I really had a hard time just getting through this film The performances were excellent but how much of that dark sombre uninspired stuff can you take The only thing i liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene Otherwise this was a ripoff of Bergman And im no fan f his either I think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 12 hours of this is well lying
1	Fascinating movie based on a true story about an Australian woman Lindy Chamberlain Meryl Streep accused of killing her baby daughter She insists that a dingo took her baby but the story is highly suspicious The film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case the way Australians interpreted what was presented in the media and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the womans conviction based on barely any hard evidence I love films that question the media and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system Ive always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 Angry Men before they go through with their duties Its not as has often been said a liberal movie but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge A Cry in the Dark is likewise clinical Schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic Some may find the film boring or dry but I found it engaging
0	I saw this back in 94 when it was finally released Apparently because Orion pictures was in bankruptcy I think the movie had not been released a couple of years earlierbr br I have problem remembering details partly because I havent seen it in a long time but I do remember it as a very dull movie I kept debating whether to walk out of it The store was not at all interesting or engaging Was a 3rd rate America Graffiti imitation br br None of the performances make it worth watching either One of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper reviewer gave it a high rating
1	Well Cube 1997 Vincenzos first movie was one of the most interesting and tricky ideas that Ive ever seen when talking about movies They had just one scenery a bunch of actors and a plot So what made it so special were all the effective direction great dialogs and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal like rats in a labyrinth His second movie Cypher 2002 was all about its story but it wasnt so good as Cube but here are the characters being tested like rats againbr br Nothing is something very interesting and gets Vincenzo coming back to his Cube days locking the characters once again in a very different space with no time once more playing with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room But instead of a thriller scifi even some of the promotional teasers and trailers erroneous seemed like that Nothing is a loose and light comedy that for sure can be called a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world were living Once again Vicenzo amaze us with a great idea into a so small kind of thing 2 actors and a blinding white scenario thats all you got most part of time and you dont need more than that While Cube is a claustrophobic experience and Cypher confusing Nothing is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperatebr br This movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget Of course that the movie fails sometimes but its prime idea means a lot and offsets any flaws Theres nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that I had in movies since Cube
0	I saw this movie years ago and I was impressed but then again I was only 12 years old I recently rewatched it and want that time back This film is pretty bad While I like Lee Majors Chris Makepeace watch My Bodyguard 1980if you would like to see a GOOD movie that he was in of Meatballs also starring Bill Murray for some laughs and Burgess Meredith this role doesdid nothing for their careersbr br Anyway Lee Majors character Franklyn Hart is an ex race car driver who plans on driving his race car which he had in storage across the country to California One Problem The government has outlawed all private transportation I thought the concept was OK not the worse Ive heard of but the execution failed horribly
0	Lame lame lame A 90minute cringefest thats 89 minutes too long A setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility an abandoned convent is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky witless dialogue thats straining ohsohard to be hip Mostly its just embarrassing and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat a sample of this movies dialogue after demonstrating her artillery fast dolly shot to a closeup of Barbeaus vigilante character she any questions hyuck hyuck hyuck Bad acting idiotic homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects it looks like the directors watched The Evil Dead way too many times br br I owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes theyll never get back What a turd
0	Note to Horror fans The only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie thats so worthless its insultingbr br I watched this becausebr br The premise sounded slightly promising Its not Its just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other lowbudget slasher films that werent good either br br The promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful Its not Its SO not The amateur cinematography makes sure the fallen angels are about as sexy as the average homeless personbr br The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre Hes the king of lowbudget special effects and lowerbudget acting Come to think of it Savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie Its not that hes bad but hes almost always in bad movies His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn and hes been milking that at horror conventions ever sincebr br But lets focus on the positive Forest of the Damned is a great example of how NOT to make a movie br br Everything else is a negative Obviously the writer is allergic to originality The script is terrible Thats all a given after the first 10 minutes But the clueless pacing the way the director treats plot and characterization as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway and the excruciatingly long and boring driving walking and nature sequences no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in generalbr br This is another good example of the numberone way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad If its written and directed by the same person expect garbage
1	dark angel rocks the best show i have seen in ages damn those people who took it off me and my friends have gatherings to watch every DA episode takes like 4 days but it is worth it it finished before it finished what it wanted to say and that annoys the hell out of me
0	I didnt expect a movie as good as In The Line of Fire or an episode of 24 but it looked like this movie was made for TV and did a mediocre job at best The good cast couldnt disguise the fact that the plot was all too predictable and actors had to struggle they really try their best I think through their lines of bad script giving their rather flat characters any extras When I watched the movie I got the feeling that I had seen most of this in other better movies In it you had car chases big shootouts romance plot twists etc etc This movie has nonebr br Spoiler As soon as you see another woman talking into the phone to Cubas character you know whos behind all this and all the hints youre being given you stand too close to the president see it from my perspective sound silly br br If it were up to me and maybe its a good thing that it isnt I would rewrite the plot like thisbr br First lady orders the murder of her husband because she is sick and tired of writing checks to Cuba all the time
0	Wow I do not think I have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast Justin Timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that Edison hadbr br His acting was PAINFUL to observe The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors heck even LL Cool J was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on How the director and movie company figured that Timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehendbr br His character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass and he is supposed to be the hero I would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video MAYBE if you have HBO and have NOTHING else to do at 2am on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned this may be OKbr br Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human Kermit the Frog act in a Hollywood Blockbuster just didnt work at all
1	Personally I enjoyed Cut thouroughly It was the first time Ive seen a theatrically release Australian slasher flick A genre normally restricted to the mainstream hollywood filmsbr br With all the usual cooky comedies and dramas coming out of Australia I loved being able to see a homegrown horror movie that wasnt a rip off of anything I didnt even think it was really a spoof of other movies It was a supernaturally theme horror like Nightmare on Elm Street not Scream or I know What You Did Last Summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief I think its about time Australian films tried to get more into the mainstream genresbr br Cut was original scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun Id give it seven out of ten and wouldnt treat it as anything serious It did what I expected it to do entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying I enjoyed it
0	Youd think that with Ingrid Bergman and Warner Baxter that this film would have been a lot better Sadly the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brainaddledbr br The film begins with Ingrid Bergman coming to work for the Stoddard family Everything is so very peachy and swellthe family adores Bergman and things couldnt be more perfect Well that is until the mother Fay Wray dies the stock market crashes in 1907 wiping out the familys fortune and Bergman is forced to go back home to France This portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet but not badbr br Later after the familys fortunes have improved Bergman returns The four boys are now all grown and there isnt really a conceivable reason why theyd hire her once again as a governess But briefly everything is swell once again But when WWI occurs the four all go to wargosh In the midst of this one of the sons David brings home his new wife Susan Hayward Miss Haywards character is as black and white as the others though while they are all good and swell shes obviously a horny shedevil To make things worse she comes to live in the family home while David is at warbr br Now here is where the movie gets really really dumbbrainachingly dumb Hayward begins an affair with one of Davids brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers Bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her not Hayward with Jack WHY Why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman This was exactly the sort of excuse Bergman needed to get rid of the guttersnipe once and for all This is just a case of lousy writing and made me madand most likely did the same to the audiences back in 1941br br The rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for Haywards evilness to be exposed This just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess As expected however the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once againhappy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut Haywardbr br The film suffers because of poor writing Haywards affair made no senseat least in how it was handled And having characters who are so goshdarn good or evil with nothing in between sinks this movie to the level of a secondrate soap The only thing that saves it at all is the actingthey tried as best they could with a turgid script Suffice to say that the Columbia Pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken
1	Yes Be My Love was Mario Lanzas skyrocket to fame and still is popular today His voice was strong and steady so powerful in fact that MGM decided to use him in The Great Caruso Lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of Caruso Having read the book by Kostelanitz who wrote a biography of Lanza he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary Caruso to Lanza There is no doubt that Lanza did a superb job in the story but the story is not entirely true blame it on Hollywood I used to practise singing his songs years ago and became pretty good myself until I lost my voice because of emphysemaasthma ten years ago Reaching the high note of Be My Love is not easy but beautiful
1	This is not the typical Mel Brooks film It was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable Leslie Ann Warren made the movie she is such a fantastic underrated actress There were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so but all in all this is worth the price to rent and see it The acting was good overall Brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience Again Warren was the best actor in the movie but Fume and Sailor both played their parts well
0	Dull haunted house thriller finds an American family moving into a 200 year old house in Japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred br br Novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of Motel Hell The film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall br br One obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned The monk recounts the history of the house which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence and then the film simply cuts away to something else Earlier the monk had offered to help Well where is the help The family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earliertry to drive the spirits out of the house although by this time its difficult for the viewers to carebr br There are some probably unintentional campy laughs in seeing the American actors at the end become possessed by the Japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts I say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same directors Motel Hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing but on the whole this is a forgettable dud
1	SPOILERS 911 is a very good and VERY realistic documentary about the attacks on the WTC2 French film makers who are in New York to film the actions of a NYFD are being confronted with this event and make the most of itBefore 911 nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario On the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon changeAs one the film makers goes on the road with the firemen he films the first crashing planethis is the only footage of the first impactHe rides with the firemen to the WTC and goes inside the buildingAs the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accidentIn the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possiblein the meanwhile we hear banging soundsthese are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the groundthis is the most grueling moment in the documentaryThen the tower collapses and our French friend has to run for his lifeyou hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the buildingThen a huge sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns blackhe was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of Downtown New York Because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was ment to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybodys memoryI saw the attacks live at home because I had the afternoon ofso this makes it even more realistic to watch 1010

0	I cant believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie The Gingerbread Man starts of on the right foot and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending But at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories Ive ever wasted my time on Its just so unbelievably how the bewitched Mallory Doss manages to pull Kenneth Branaghs character around by his nose The movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer which has been left out in the sun too long The Gingerbread Man is probably the worst Grishammovie ever and this isnt changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie Dont waste your time here
0	I have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film One thing I see over and over is annoyance with Megan the idealistic political scientist trying to change the world I loved her character Maybe because I am a 23 year old political science student and I think Im going to change the world too so I relate to Megan Besides shes cute Shes no super model but more of a cute girl next doorbr br OK so she cried and screamed a lot Its very dramatic and seems overdone but doesnt it fit her character She goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point She thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick I think she made her argument very well Of course being a young naive girl she is terrified of what she is about to face I think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear Furthermore I think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was inbr br As for the movie in general other than Megan it was pretty much what I expected It had excellent gore scenes by microbudget standards The plot maybe took a quick thought hardly any contemplation Its basically just a dark humorist senseless slasher film which the name implies I love the sadism of the doctor He kept ripping Megans shirt off not just for the cause of sleaze though largely so but also to torment her before he kills her The Chainsaw hick was hilarious For slasher film lovers he was probably the best characterbr br I give this film 4 out of 10 It had a good setting almost no plot and a mix of good and terrible acting I would recommend it for a cheap thrill but hardly a diamond in the rough that is microbudget horror

0	Cheap and mindblisteringly dull story and acting Not a single good line not even a line bad enough to be good and no memorable delivery Even the blooper reel included with the DVD showed how inept the actors were and how little fun any of them were having The esoteric and occult basis was apathetically inauthentic and the antagonists failed to be creepy or believable The homoerotic overtones were pointlessly tame and dissatisfying and were limited to young boys caressing their chests while flaccid in their boxers Im not gay enough to appreciate it but a little action might have at least kept me and my girlfriend awake
1	I watched this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the UK Well actually it doesnt because this film is everything a Hollywood film isnt original creative quirky and humorous It seems that today noone really wants to see this type of movie as in the simplest terms it doesnt conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a filmbr br I havent written a review for the IMDb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes Essentially it is about nothing as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world The brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only miseenscene consists of half a house and a vast white empty space This is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their rolesbr br Id love to write some more but am on quite a time limit However I encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try A very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and wellexecuted fashion with the combination of good performances a strong script nice sound design and fairly impressive visuals creating a very entertaining moviebr br Its just a shame so few people know about Nothing
0	Not only was this the most expensive Canadian film ever shot in BC but easily the worst never seeing the light of day The director is not even Canadian but British and boy does it show We are all made out to be a bunch of oversexed dope fiends and morons The spirit of what it means to be Canadian is absent and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk Of course the British character is normal The rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype can you say Norm The cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes The actors always seem to be fidgetting Are they as bored as the viewer or is this the directors idea of cinema Avoid this mess and check out some of Bruce Mcdonalds films A true Canadian boy with something original to say cinematically You wont be compelled to walk out on HIS films after 10 minutes

1	Remember these two stories fondly and in the first set in the not too distant future we see a young boy preparing for examination day the state iq test The boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test Upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why The examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth The boy then asks puzzled again why wouldnt he It is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry but their sons iq level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial A corker of a concluding scene A Message From Charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present Which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present A nice story with a heartwarming conclusion
0	Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to be in this film and be forced to play a partMexican or he would have been suspended Believe me he made the wrong choice Presumably after the success of Dodge City Warners tried a followup with Errol Flynn and his usual list of buddies like Alan Hale Guinn Big Boy Williams Frank Mc Hugh and the everpresent John Litel but they made the huge mistake of trying to present Miriam Hopkins as a love interest for Flynn v Randolph Scott and as a singer to really make things bad because she proved one thing and that is she cannot sing The story was not too bad but with Bogie clearly miscast also it turned out to be a poor Western that was overlong and on a low budget but in fairness color would not have helped

1	To those who say that this movie deserves anything below the unflaunting grace that it showed I disagree This is an amazing documentary about a shocking daybr br IMDB asks us to rate this movie I beg you to consider the fact that the documentary was made The courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable We find that the two brothers are split up when that moment happened They continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing about their own and eachothers safety To judge whether its nobler to shoot a video of that tragedy or to save the lives as those amazing amazing firefighters did is not mine to answer I just know that in 30 years a class full of children will not know one without the otherbr br I submit a wholehearted 10 This is why the art of filming was created To capture the natural emotion that real life offers You can keep your kungfu junk Romance is cute Action will never reach this level This movie 911 will be timeless in that it did not glorify itself It didnt have a sneakpeek It didnt have all of the blatant vanities that a lions share of the many movies on the many screens blare It had class composure substance and it had a record of the day that changed the modern face of America and even the world It spoke of things inescapable to the eye of the camera Please consider this movie as it itself proclaims a stirring tribute to all of those who fell because of the free beautiful name of Americabr br How can you give anything less to a movie that shows not embellishes the natural bravery of real people acting in unreal times I love The Godfather but 911 is forever a different kind of movie as this is now a different kind of world It is art without question or questionsbr br jf
0	I remembered the title so well To me it was a Flora Robson movie with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in supporting roles And it had Vincent Masseys voice from behind whiskers Well Flora Robson was great Her next signature for me would be 55 Days at Peking The same role but with different sumptuous gowns And the same voice As for the Armada it was a subtext I like blackandwhite films Was everything done in Elizbethan times at night It was talky and difficult to fathom at times I couldnt tell which was the love interest Was it the Spaniard or was it Vivien Leigh And I do not believe that Elizabeth I would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the Armada Apparently it worked for the Empire but not for the script This might have been more accurate historically but Bette Davis had more engaging scripts And I missed daylight
0	This version is pretty insipid Im afraid Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood but William Hurts weary throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of Edward Rochester and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a bored petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt I also cant believe that they eliminated Edwards great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book one of the most moving moments in literature I do appreciate that they finally used such a young plain woman to play Jane a character who is supposed to be a worldly 18 but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel please see the 70s version with George C Scott and Susannah York York was too old tall and pretty to play Jane but no one has touched Rochesters character the way that Scott did
1	This movie is intelligent That is more than most other movies it transcends the least common denominator stupid people will probably not appreciate it The story also relies heavily on dialogue It has some parallels to Lost in Translation although Before Sunrise is much brighter somehow less abstract and simply a lot betterbr br The script the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic The actors play absolutely brilliantly Rarely have I seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly togetherbr br The dialogue moves into very personal issues with the risk of becoming a little over the top It does however stay on the right side almost all the time although I found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing Balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors Sometimes it yields great results and overall this movie is simply stupendous Only very very rarely is love in films depicted in a way that I find trustworthy and realistic Every time that is achieved the result is fantastic I think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect She still looks stunning in this film 12 years afterbr br This is simply a gem of a movie that you cant miss One of the best movies I have seen from the 1990s
1	An unqualified 10 The level of writing and acting in this Australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of old Hollywood Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together Neill matches Streep line for line and take for take it is one of the best showcases yet of his prodigious acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best notwithstanding the intensity of his role This engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms The movie which won several top awards in Australia boasts not only a superlative cast and director but wonderful and authentic Australian locales It proves that people are the same the world over And after all these years people still delight in repeating the famous Streep line accent and all A dingo ate moy baby Including that imp Elaine Benis on Seinfeld

1	Unfortunately SpaceCamp came out about the same time as the Challenger Explosion Which really put a crimp on when to bring it out or even if they should bring it out Im glad they did I first watched SpaceCamp at a drivein movie Which really enhanced the viewing a lotbr br While I had heard of Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt I had never heard of the others in the movie So it came as a big shock to me to find all those youngsters acting and acting real good Of course Kate Capshaw was excellent toobr br I especially liked the scenes where those kids were being shown how to act as a team The scenes of the kids being prepared for a trip they could only hope for The actual launch of a spacecraft is of course old news to us However this one was differentbr br All in all this is one of my most treasured films Escapist maybe but it was fantastic for a space nut like me After probably renting it for 30 40 times I finally found it available in a certain store and bought it Now if it only comes out on DVD I will probably have it forever This movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me
0	Theres something frustrating about watching a movie like Murder By Numers because somewhere inside that Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out However by the time the credits roll theres no saving it The whole thing is pretty much blown by the cop side of the story where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplins homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on Although Bullock is strong in her role its not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing Ben Chaplins talents are wasted in a forgettable role he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated Birthday Girl as well as Chris Penn who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him Anyway the plot really isnt even a factor in this movie at all The two teen killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie Their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well Its too bad they werent in a much better allaround film Barbet Schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker Bottom Line its worth a rent if youre a genre fan but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it except maybe on network TV with convenient commercial breaks
0	This film had a great cast going for it Christopher Lee Dean Jagger Macdonald Carey Lew Ayres solid bmovie actors all But this downer of a movie didnt use any of them to any sort of advantage with none of their characters even meeting on screen though Christopher Lee does get to play opposite himself in several scenesbr br The motivations for the aliens in this movie seem to change at the drop of a hat First they just want to repair their ship and leave then they turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he gets them the crucial part they need Then out of nowhere this peaceful race decides they have to destroy the planet because it causes too many diseases though they do offer the main character and his wife a spot in their societybr br Most of the film is spent watching the man and wife drive or walk or stand around or sit at desks doing nothing You almost wish they had gotten taken out with the rest of the planet at the end just in vengeance for boring us to deathbr br Unless you really like Chris Lee or seventies lowbudget scifi Id give this one a miss It falls into that narrow range of wasted celluloid between Star Odyssey and UFO Target Earth
0	Mt little sister and I are selfproclaimed horror movie buffs We have seen just about EVERYTHING especially zombie flicks Now we have seen a lot of good zombie movies and a lot of bad ones This BY FAR is the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life Not only was the acting horrible but the special effects graphics and ever zombie makeup was the worst I have seen If you can even call it makeup black eye shadow around the eyes This is totally proof that you should never judge a book by its cover Cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about do your selves a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE I was so adamant about this movie I went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying This movie sucks dont waste your time return NOW hahahhaa I dont want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this POS movie i dont even know how it got the ratings that it did t should be in the negative
1	The Night Listener held my attention with Robin Williams shining as a New York City radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy Rory Culkin who is very ill Williams has never met the boy in person as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone However Williams exboyfriend nice job from Bobby Cannavale raises doubt about the boy which prompts Williams to arrange a meeting with him in person What follows makes a permanent impact on Williams in a way he does not expect I will leave it at that Toni Collette also starsbr br I enjoyed this film with Toni Collette giving a memorable portrayal of Culkins adoptive mother Sandra Oh also starred as Williams friend The Night Listener is inspired by actual events and it has a somber almost creepy silence throughout At times it is predictable no thanks to some of the reviews I read before seeing the movie and just due to logic but I liked it anyway I enjoy Williams in roles like this more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me Recommended 810
1	At first i didnt think that Ben Affleck could really pull off a funny Christmas movie boy was i wrong my daughter invited me to watch this with her and i was not disappointed at all James Gandolfini was funny i really liked Christina Appelagate and Catherine O Hara was good too the storyline is what really sold me i mean too put up with family at the table for people you only hardly see but once or twice a year and probably dont get along with anyway you really do need as much alcohol as youre system can stand to deal with Christmas so i thought that the premise was good there buying the family with 250000 dollars was a little on the far fetched side but it turned out to work pretty good for me cause it was a riot all the way through it shows the class struggle of the different families it has lots of funny moments including embarrassing stuff on the computer for a teenage boy all in all i loved this movie and will watch it again next Christmas or sooner if my daughter wants too
1	Never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by Cagney and the other cast members namely Dick Powell Scott Blair who had a great tenor voice and Ruby Keeler Bea Thorn James Cagney plays the role as Chester Kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing Prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theaters during the 1930s Chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows This is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs Joan Blondell Nan Prescott gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty Dick Powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career Enjoy
0	How this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me This is a terrible cliché ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done It really surprises me that so many of these A list stars would agree to this unfunny film Whats even worse is the fact that is made almost 100 million here in the states It does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks even if the film is terrible I felt sorry for everyone involved in this snorefest Billy Crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions Whatever you do dont fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this
0	Elvis has left the building and hes lucky because he didnt have to watch this unfunny stinker Scene after scene director Joel Zwick finds ways to make an unfunny script even less amusing Filled with unfunny deaths trite gay characteratures and hack jokes this film is more desperate than amusing This is the sort of film that makes one hope Kim Basinger follows Doris Day into premature retirement Let us remember her the way she was talented and not what shes become David Leisure the delicious Dennis Richards and the rest are all wasted talents here Zwick finds a way to minimize their talents at every turn The guy playing Elvis sounds more like Gomer than the KingThe only really good bit of casting is the young girl who plays Basinger as a preteen She really looks like her and is actually pretty good The only other reason to watch this film at all is to look for the Tom Hanks cameo The cameo isnt all that funny but at least its not painful One has to wonder if Zwick has incriminating pictures of Hanks or something that would make him do this movie

1	I just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable It is a quiet little film that doesnt overwhelm you with special effects or big performances It simply takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of North Carolina br br Henry Thomas gives a good performance as Raymond Toker a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods Tokers search for the babys parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life David Srathairn plays Truman Lester a slimy conman with an ulterior motive And David plays the bad guy to perfection br br There is much more to this film than first meets the eye Filmed on location in North Carolina and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music it is worth watching
1	A Cry in the Dark is a masterful piece of cinema haunting and incredibly though provoking The true story of Lindy Chamberland who in 1980 witnessed a horrific sight seeing her 3monthold baby being brutally taken from their familys tent while camping on the Austrailian outback Azaria the baby was never seen again and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world Meryl Streep does immaculate justice to the role of Lindy as she always does But the one thing that helps A Cry in the Dark never fall flat is the brilliant direction A truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case tears are brought to the eyes The concept is nothing less then terrifying and afterwards you are left haunted but also inspired

0	If Fassbinder has made a worse film I sure dont want to see it Anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to view this to learn to appreciate the more spare style he opted for in excellent films like The Bitter Tears Of Petra von Kant This film bogs down with so much arty quasisymbolic images it looks like a parody of an artfilm The scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where Elviras prostitute friend channelsurfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewers endurance But what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just Elvira and her exwife andor her daughter These are the only moments that display any real human emotion and prove that at the core of this horrible film there was an excellent film struggling to free itself What a waste
1	As is nearly always the case when Britain comes up with an entertaining andor successful sitcom or quiz show the Yanks will come along and poach the format and produce their own grossly inferior version Man About The House is of course no exception to that rule The Yanks version Threes Company was unwatchable braindead pap that seem to run forever A prime example of quantity over nonexistent quality The original on the other hand is a fondlyremembered gem that had the savvy like Fawlty Towers to pull the plug at precisely the right time unlike the 637 episodes of hilarity that Threes Company came up with Jo was cute there was brilliant chemistry between the Ropers Richard OSullivan made it all look so easy the scripts whilst not exactly Oscar Wildestandard were consistently funny and Chrissy was THE most dropdead gorgeous woman who has walked the face of this planet since The Dead Sea was merely feeling unwell Nuff said
1	As many reviewers here have noted the film version differs quite a bit from the stage version of the story I have never seen the stage version of the story and therefore I have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers Perhaps Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers trying to make the big time in choreographer Michael Douglas show The film does right by not selecting any famous actors or performers to wind up in the final tryout group This way our attention is focused on the dancers movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of tryouts Douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part Apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new one and the backstage clichéridden story of a romantic liaison between a dancer and the choreographer was added I have to say in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film The repeated intrusions Cassie made during tryouts appear to mirror the almost desperate pleas one often has to make when engaging in the artistic professions in the absence of talent andor luck However this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past and its curious to see this tired old shoe kicking its heel up once again The revelations of the dancers themselves began promisingly enough with the I can do that number but then it plodded a little at various points while the dancers were telling their stories Frankly their stories differed little from real life folks who never get a chance like this of 4 stars
1	This movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation Women and performers both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in China This makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culturebr br The only problem I had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors performancebr br A welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies

0	Simply not the quality I expected from Morris love Brass Eye and Blue Jam This is very much like a not so bad student film What concerns me in all this is WHY DID IT WIN A BAFTA Morris makes fun of enshrined mediocrity Ayn Rand in much of his work Nathan Barley and yet with this piece is urinating down the backs of the talented and telling us its raining br br I just hope as he has chosen a subject I would love to tackle the humanity of terrorism Four Lions that he isnt going to cock that up wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of mainstream ignorance and opinion on this emotive and heavily spun phenomena
0	I rented this DVD for two reasons A cast of great actors and the director even though Robert Altman can be hit or miss In this case it was a big miss Altmans attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good film like Dead Again I didnt think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey and I hope it didnt ruin his reputation Robert Duvall seems to have fallen the way of most onetime Oscar winners On a downward spiral that includes acting in eatingmoney films such as this one Duvall was once a great actor in excellent films even though his best performance was not Tender Mercies but The Great Santini This movie was truly a big waste of time I give it a 2 out of 10
1	These two men went thru hell and beyond and have produced the movie that conveys the terror that many did not survive This is definitely a movie about survival but not without its touching momentsbr br The finest piece of work I have seen documenting the 91101 tragedy of New York City
0	This film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful mens wivesbr br I thought The Walker would be thrilling and engaging but I was so wrong The pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow that even after 40 minutes of the film nothing happens much Seriously the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes Thats how slow it isbr br The fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom Its almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion Maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class br br Its sad that The Walker becomes such a boring mess despite such a strong cast Blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing
0	I sincerely consider this movie as another poor effort of Dominican Movie Industry The first 30 minutes of the movie are a little funny but then when they switch their role in the society men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do the movie falls Becoming boring and not funny at all They let many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predictable I didnt like the way as a Roberto Angel played his character and his little either I went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work but I went out really disappointedbr br I dont recommend this movie
1	I dont agree with one of the reviewers who compared this film to the American International Pictures Basil Deardon has directed a brutally realistic film with an honest attempt to portray the rise of juvenile delinquency in post war England but without the sentimentality of Blackboard Jungle The cinematography was excellent as it really captured the scariness and isolation of the huge housing estate The estate looked like an old prison Stanley Baker was excellent as the hardened detective reassigned to the juvenile division Urgent urgent Larceny five iced lollies He finds he is the butt of many jokes David McCallum showed that he was one of Britains top young talents of the fifties He had a very different role in another Stanley Baker film Hell Drivers His portrayal of Johnny and the fanatical following he inspired was very frightening Ann Heywood was also very good as the cynical Cathie I wouldnt say there was a romantic subplot in itbr br Detective Jack Truman is investigating a string of arson attacks by someone labeled the Firefly Just as he finds evidence which could lead to a breakthrough he is assigned to the Juvenile Division he is pretty disgusted at what he feels is not proper police work Amid all the heckling he gets his first call out the 6 year old Murphy twins are working a scam at the local lolly shopsbr br Taking the twins home he meets their brother the charismatic Johnny and their embittered sister Cathie He starts to appreciate how life on the ghastly housing estates can turn young kids into criminals As he gets more involved with the family he realises there is a strong link between the fires Johnny and a frightened Chinese youth who works for a laundry The local priest Peter Cushing in an unusual role away from the Hammer horrors explains that when Johnny was younger he had rescued some people from a burning building and had been hailed a hero He wanted to recapture the feeling of importance and being useful and felt he could by lighting fires The school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the childrens fear the teacher thinking only of her own safety runs off and locks them in the room with the frightened gunmanbr br I thought it was a really excellent film that tried to show some of the social problems Britain experienced after the warbr br Highly Recommended
0	I own almost every Seagal movie yes even ones like this that are low budget and I must say this may be the worst not only of his movies but of all movies ever made The only highlight of this film and only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that A it is Seagal and B Seagal does have some sweet action sequences specifically in the store and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife Next time give me 90 minutes of Seagal killing people and dont even bother with a story line because the storyline not only stunk but so did the acting the fact that F18s and F14s somehow changed into F16s and also the fact that the Stealth was as fast as an F16 Also the Stealth never had to refuel And since when is Afghanistan considered hostile territory from an Air Force stand point last I checked Afghanistan has no Air Force we USA control the skies Also this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room yet the Admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret Also how did Seagal go from the bottom of the truck to the top PLease tell us why they jailed him Since when are Air Force pilots great commandos unless they are Owen Wilson And since when are their drunks in Arab countries considering Muslims dont drink alcohol Also on top of that since when do Arabs listen to orders from females like the 2 in charge The highlight of the film was definitely Seagal killing people in the store and the other 50 people he killed with a knife as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere
0	this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad hence can i advice anyone to watch it well i was kinda obliged by the fact that in was in the tiff competition i still cant believe it wonand i only remained until the end because the director was there for a qa sectionbut that was also anything but interesting whats it about well the first half the worth watching one presents three characters a hooker a musician and some kind of officialthe first two lie about their professionsbut the third is the actual liar the second half do something elsedont ruin a good evening includes some old breasts and heavy drinking but maybe you will see it completely differentthe tiff jury did were they drinking vodka
1	And I am a Nicole Kidman fanatic I would pay to see and hear her read the Moscow phone book which for all I know she may have been doing when she was speaking Russian in this movie br br All four of the principals are excellent but the movie itself is a number of good images and better scenes held together by nothingbr br While one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie this one asks too much of the viewer br br It could have been very funny which it is in parts or quite frightening which it is in one scene but the director didnt seem to know which way to go
0	I actually have a fondness for Christopher Lee but this just wasnt up to his other performances and he was one of the better actorsbr br The film does not live up to its premise Its not that scary its overly melodramatic and it draaaaaags Every time I thought Oh HERE comes the good part the good part never quite arrivedbr br The Evil Ones arent at all convincing Most of the other characters were also lacking in depthbr br Perhaps if Id been in the proper frame of mind I might have enjoyed some MSTiefication at this films expense but Naaahhh Didnt really seem to be worth the effort It wasnt really very good it wasnt really very bad it was just mediocre
0	Carly Pope plays JJ a newly promoted Food Critic whose flamboyant overbearing mother moves in with her JJ aghast at this turn of events then blackmails restaurant owner Alex to entertain her mother in exchange for maybe reviewing his dying restaurant Alex predictably falls for the daughter while warming to the mother There are numerous problems with this movie the characters are universally 2dimensional JJ is a selfserving hateful character her mother superficial and shallow JJs colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic The underlying message of an over50 woman unable to make it on her own without male assistance is bad bad BAD The acting is uniformly dull the script uninspired The films only saving grace is the setting of New York City I would so NOT recommend this film
1	Anyone who loves the Rheostatics music is going to enjoy this film I have some minor complaints mainly about pacing and the casting of certain actors not Maury who arent really convincing in their roles but I dont have time write a detailed review I just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or plans to watch this film as presented CBC television in Canada The version that airs are the CBC is like the Readers Digest version of WHALE MUSICdont watch it It cuts out entire scenes and subplots if you can them that from the film The CBC which presents most of films untouched took half the guts out of WHALE MUSIC I dont know why Its horrible what they did to the film Rent the video or watch it in a theatre but DONT watch it on CBC television
0	Wow I just saw this on TV as one of the scary movies they show around Halloween Was this rated G There wasnt really anything to make this movie scary or worth watching Also other people say this is a spoof but I dont think so For a spoof you need something called humor This lowbudget crapfest didnt have a shred of humor and it didnt make much sense either You basically have a goofy looking monster man in rubber suit coming out of closets killing people I guess since you never see the monster doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath The spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster so I guess thats good enoughbr br The military tries feebly to kill the monster which isnt much larger than a man They have very bad aim Then the military FLEES Wow did this movie make the US military look pathetic or what The monster while hard to kill doesnt do much besides shuffle around and roar Oh and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks It was a slightly interesting yet a total Alien ripoffbr br What was the deal with the scientist playing the Xylophone to attract the monster It was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality Also why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long Why didnt the monster go into the closet when it had a chance Why do I insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless
0	Horrible acting Bad story line cheesy makeup and this is just the tip of the iceberg I have never seen a worse movie in my life 5 minutes in I decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen It didnt Aside from a nice breast shot The movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse and the same warehouse was used for at least 90 of the sets You even see this same red chair in several different locations If you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment not some warehouse which will echo all your actors dialog Note to producers Renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable If you spend your money to rent this people I hope you got it with a return guarantee You will be demanding your money back I only spent 299 to rent this tonight and I feel ripped off

1	This one is tough to watch as an earlier reviewer says That is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after WWII particularly the liberation of Dachau It is clear that as of the middle of the war we knew exactly what was happening to the Jews The sequence that shows a transport is vivid almost as if based upon an actual newsreel the Nazis liked to record their atrocities Knox as the Nazi is brilliant He charts the course of a Nazi career That charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other Germans at first laughing at Hitler then incredulous and finally helpless That contrast however permits us to believe in the conversion of one young Nazi officer to an antiNazi stance That did happen as witness the several attempts against Hitler most notably the Staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out A strong film effectively using flashbacks accurately predicting the Nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended

1	Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic The plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal Billy Zane Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack Leonardo DiCaprio a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game If he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyesbr br The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the Titanic which has recently occurred One of the survivors of the Titanic Rose DeWitt Bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic With this the scene shifts to Southhampton Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10 1912 as all the passengers are boarding After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger Jack Dawson Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the Titanics legs out to full speed The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie On April 15 1912 at 1139 an iceberg was sighted They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanics many pleas for help The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking Also the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle Overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanicbr br Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship The core group of Rose Jack Cal and Roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown Captain Edward Smith the ship designer Thomas Andrew the White Star Line Representative Bruce Ismay and all of the Titanics officers were real The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaires Captain when the Titanic sunk The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former Canadian hometown As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations In addition Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss Not wanting to leave her husbands side Mrs Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic Furthermore Mr Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best The richest man on the ship John Jacob Astor who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat In addition Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware The gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the PostVictorian era of 1912 The rich at this time practically ruled everything as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do The rich did not take well to new money such as Molly Brown as depicted Everything of the time was very formal Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtakingbr br A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise The director James Cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night In addition this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed However the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matterbr br Technically the film is very well done To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie In addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship Furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the filmbr br Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic Like most history novels we know the ending but it doesnt take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for youbr br
0	I read the novel Jane Eyre for the first time back in 1986 It was round that time that I saw the BBCversion with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke It was an excellent version and very much like the book Years later I laid eyes on this version and was horrified William Hurt is totally miscast as Mr Rochester Mr Rochester is a passionate character where as William Hurt portrays him as a block of ice The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough It was like watching two zombies together This is story about love and passion but I couldnt see it in this version No back to the BBCversion A wonderful time is guaranteed
1	br br This is definitely a must see for those who occasionally smoke a reefer in their secret hideout trying to avoid being caught by parents teachers the police etc The protagonist is a lady in her forties living in her mansion breeding orchids and absolutely unaware of the fact that her socalled rich and truthful husband is actually broke and cheating on her When he all of the sudden dies she is confronted with the truth The bailiff comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt She doesnt know what to do until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in Britain She decides after some long thinking to get rid of her flowers and start breeding pot instead The story is quite original the performances outstanding I can think of only a few movies that made me laugh more than this one Still the melodramatic touch is present The film is typical British the jokes arent vulgar there is no violence involved It shouldnt be mentioned that it is recommended to have taken a few draughts before watching Saving grace It will be so much more fun Especially the scene with the 2 old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious I thought my jawbones would burst 910

0	First of all I am not a huge fan of contemporary Turkish cinema which is because the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline This movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos as the director and marketing ads imply In my mere opinion the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive moralein fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country Cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what I meantbr br However the acting is near perfect In fact most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what Altioklar lacked talent All members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job even the less experienced ones Like Janset At least Altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation just because he knows well how to choose the cast Other than that he is just a media monkey who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent Come on art is not something that solely consists of dealing with nakedhalf naked women And just because media boasts off no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema Just close your ears and o something real artistic I am waiting eagerly to applause your next work Hope this time you manage to achieve an artistic approachbr br In short Pros Good acting hot women just kidding Cons Each and every single thing other than the cast
1	Excellent show Instead of watching the same old sitcom type shows where its the same old thing just different stars this refreshing show provided an incredibly entertaining view of office situations We have been away from watching any television for 2 years and after coming back of all the shows available we look forward to watching this show on W Shame on Global for pulling the plug on this one I thought this one would be a winner Lets be realistic about things FEW Canadian SHOWS make it Everyone I talk to enjoys this show and I believe it was foolish of Global to walk away I guess they want to stick it out with the typical mind numbing shows from the States instead of pulling behind a Canadian made show that had a lot of promise Dont get me wrong I enjoy a lot of shows on TV but come on people lets keep the variety This unique show provided a very comedic view of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships with unique characters that you dont see on any sitcoms today or in the past Too bad that global had to say no to this one foolish mistake
1	I think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words Clueless and appalling nonsense I think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment One has to suspend ones disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman could fall in love have a child and live together happily ever after But it is always wonderful to see it played out in a movie and have ones heart warmed Is it so impossible There are far more implausible events described in other movies The acting is good the script is funny The only negative comment is that the story could well have ended when the family drives away from its initial house instead of extending on to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality
1	In the spirit of the classic The Sting this movie hits where it truly hurts in the heart A prim proper female psychiatrist hungry for adventure meets up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundrals The vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman and begs to be involved in his operation While the movie moves kind of slow its climax and ending are stunning Youll especially enjoy how the doctor forgives herself
1	When the Chamberlain family is camping near Ayers Rock Australia Lindy Chamberlain Meryl Streep sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience For it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press and the whole thing turns into a circus Lindy doesnt help matters either because she wont play to the jury or courtroom shes only herself and shes a tough nut to crack so of course everyone thinks shes guilty because theres a piece of evidence that hasnt come to light Sam Neill is excellent as Michael Chamberlain a SeventhDay adventist pastor who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife Its good or bad to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the States too because the Australian public doesnt believe the story and the media only fans the flames Eventually Lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor but years later a missing piece of evidence shows up and shes freed but not until after the familys life is basically ruined A heartbreaking story very well done a bit long but well worth seeing 8 out of 10
0	Wow and I thought that any Steven Segal movie was bad Every time I thought that the movie couldnt get worse it proved me wrong The story was good but the actors couldnt carry it off Also they made a lot of mistakes on how proper archiological digs are done For instance you dont handle artifacts untill they are catologed and accounted for The biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl She is a weak actress and I felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was The whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me I like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff so that almost seemed depressing I thought that the characters wernt explained well enough You didnt find out much background and that made it harder to relate to them

1	This movie had an interesting cast it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job Im glad we have b grade movies like this one the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it you dont need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot I like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didnt close down a café to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station Arnold vosloo and Michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation This was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future
0	What a stinkeroo this turned out to be At one time much earlier in her career Linda Darnell was one of my favorites no great shakes as an Actress but very beautiful and pleasant particularly in films like The Mark of Zorro and Blood and Sand but when I saw this monstrosity the memories of her golden days faded quickly The story is unbelievable and farcical the acting secondrate the supporting cast insufferable I cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to Tab Hunter and Donald Gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked Added to this was the terrible photography and I am not just referring to the color Everyone associated with this must have shuddered whenever it was shown

1	I saw this ages ago when I was younger and could never remember the title until one day I was scrolling through John Candys film credits on IMDb and noticed an entry named Once Upon a Crime Something rang a bell and I clicked on it and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memoriesbr br Ive found it has aged pretty well despite the fact that it is not by any means a great comedy It is however rather enjoyable and is a good riff on a Hitchcock formula of mistaken identity and worldwide thrillsbr br The movie has a large cast of characters amongst them an American couple who find a womans dog while vacationing in Europe and decide to return it to her for a reward only to find her dead body upon arrival From there the plot gets crazier and sillier and they go on the run after the police think they are the killersbr br Kind of a mix between Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World and a lighter Hitchcock feature this was directed by Eugene Levy and he managed to get some of his good friends such as John Candy to star in it The movie is mostly engaging due to its cast and the ending has a funny little twist that isnt totally unpredictable but also is kind of unexpected
0	The film is severely awful and is demeaning to rape victims On the surface it may be a daring film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface what lies is a notsopositive message about rape Aishwarya the rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim who cannot cope all because she is a WOMAN She needs a MAN to help her When the society makes jibes about her and throws comments at her she does not stand up for herself It is all left to Anil Kapoor to do all the talking while Aishwarya does all the cryingbr br The director Satish Kaushik went down the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive What would have been more effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way The director is famous for being chauvinistic His films are usually full of weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles He needs to learn that just because the role is controversial it does not mean that the character herself is strongbr br The most degrading scene in the film is when Aishwarya cleans herself after just being raped She does it to please her father who thinks that she is now dirty Though it is commendable that Shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a stark light what he does not show us is whether Ashs father was wrong for making his daughter do such a thing Thus we are left with a confusing message about rapebr br The comedy too is not needed in a strong subject film like this Even more so the comedy is simply not funny Ash is wooden in her role while Anil Kapoor does nothing but shout The music is mediocre except for the title track which is beautifully picturised the only bright point of this film Sonali Bendres role is disappointing and pointless Overall what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being an awful mishmash that will give some viewers severe indigestion
1	Wow alot of reviews for the Devils Experiment are here Wonderful My name is Steve and I run Unearthed Films We just started releasing the Guinea Pig films on DVD for North America Now before you ask why am I writing a review Instead ask why some people bash it Im writing this review because I love the Guinea Pig films Why do I love em its because they go for the throat and they dont let go Ive seen it all Almost every horror film known to man Argento Fulci Bava Buttgereit from every underground cult sensation to every Hollywood blockbuster Ive seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the Guinea Pig films Why because it doesnt try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place This review is for the Devils Experiment I find it devoid of story which is fine by me Why do I watch horror films So I can see blood and gore and the torture of people The Devils Experiment not only delivers but thats all it is Pure unadulterated violence Yeah I like a story but sometimes I just want the gore and the Devils Experiment delivers ten fold Why do people bash it Cause they like a story so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story It make em feel better about themselves We all want blood and gore Its just really hard to justify it if its not wrapped around a story The Guinea Pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been releasedbr br Im thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world Maybe I shouldnt have written this review but then again maybe I should My view is biased cause were releasing them but then again its not Ive always told people to find them and to watch them way before I started Unearthed Films Sure its exploitive and over the top but isnt that why we watch horror films in the 1st place The Devils Experiment is NOT for everybody Its for thrill seekers and gorehounds only If you think Jason movies and Freddy Krueger movies are awesome then stick to those But if your on the next level and have seen it all then the Devils Experiment is for you There is a reason why they havent been released for over 17 years They are wrong disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom unless she is totally cool Good luck enjoy and never stop living your life

0	Honestlythe concept behind Masters of Horror had something going for it Bigtime horror directors that are now left aside by the industry being given a chance to direct horror again I was all for it from the start That is until I watched some episodes Oh boy its really bad TV Not only does it seem like the directors are being given very little budgets to direct their skits but there seems to be guidelines as well like shooting in HD for example To make a long story short its bad both for artistic and reasons financial reasons I cannot help but compare to the Tales From The Crypt and the MoH episodes really dont stand the comparison TFTC was good MOH is bad according to me here are a few keys to explain it TFTC was shorter around 25 minutes for each episode than MOH 50 minutes per episode I believe it allowed denser screenplays with good ideas reoccurring more often better overview of an episode less chances to let the plot be confusing or boring Duration might have been also the reason why the budget was better spent on TFTC directors got to have REAL film music composers composers on MOH are if inexistent very bad REAL actors whereas on MOH its nothing but unknown actor after unknown actor REAL directors of photography and it can help sometimes REAL film cameras while MOH is shot on HD cameras with very wrongly chosen lenspieces the result of which being that the episodes of TFTC looked and felt cinematographic in the sense that there was real actors being casted ranging from Michael J Fox to Tim Roth to Kyle McLachlan to Kirk Douglas but there were also film composers behind it of the range of Alan Silvestri great directors of photography like Dean Cundey highend screenplay writers and in that sense each Tale was a little movie of its own true kind Compared to TFTC the Masters of Horrors is quite a lame approach to TV horror Its very hard to stand looking at it if your standards regarding cinematography are just a little above average because it looks the same as any ugly TV serial if not worse It gets boring and even annoying incredibly fast within the first 10 minutes usually The actors are neverheard before wannabes except for Fairuza Balk Robert Englund Angela Bettis and a few but even there they are the only famous actors of their episodes The director base for MoH was good in the beginning but its getting worst and worst with every episode now if even the directors are unknown to the world what remains Nothing And its funny how they are starting to have complete unknown directors while they havent even had say Stan Winston Dick Maas William Lustig Sam Raimi Eric Red Robert Harmon William Friedkin Jim Muro Stuart Gordon Russell Mulcahy If even Masters of Horror cannot bring dead directors back to life who will Maybe a rerun of Tales from the Crypt will

0	People tried to make me believe that the premise of this rubbishy supernatural horrorthriller was inspired by the actual last words spoken by an authentic serial killer whose name escapes me at the moment Whilst awaiting his execution in the electric chair he claimed that his soul would return to life and continue to go on a neverending murder spree Its not a highly original idea to revolve a horror film on by the way Other lowbudget turkeys implemented the exact same basic premise like House 3 Shocker and Ghost in the Machine Anyway The First Power aka Pentagram isnt a completely terrible effort but the script overly reverts to clichés and lacks genuine thrills The film starts off as an okay albeit mundane serial killer flick in which obsessive cophero Lou Diamond Philips pursues a maniac who carves bloody pentagrams into the chests of his victims He receives unexpected help from a spiritual medium played by the gorgeous and underrated Tracy Griffith She leads him to the killer but also begs not to execute him as that would result in an even bigger catastrophe Thanks to Tess helpful hints Detective Logan quickly captures the killer and celebrates his death penalty but Patrick Channing made a pact with Satan Himself and returns to the rotten streets of California to do some more killing The First Power gets pretty bad once the murderer reincarnates as a vengeful spirit Instead of using his newly gained satanic powers to wipe out the entire world thats what I would do in his position Channing simply prefers to play cat and mouse games with his nemesis the copper He annoyingly calls him BuddyBoy all the time and possesses the bodies of Logans friends and colleagues in order to trick him Even though never really boring or poorly realized its a very weak film to endure mostly because you constantly get the feeling of déjàvu Writerdirector Robert Resnikoff shamelessly uses every dreadful cliché the killer got sexually abused as a child and even the players lines can easily be predicted As soon as Griffith explains shes able to predict the future you just know that somewhere at some point in the film shes going to say the ridiculously overused line I tell people who to live their lives but my own life is a mess Yawn Lou Diamond Philips performance is adequate enough but its rather difficult to take that youthful rebel of La Bamba and Stand And Deliver serious as a tough copper There also are decent supportive roles for Mykelti Williamson Forrest Gump Carmen Argenziano When a Stranger Calls and Bmovie horror legend David Gale ReAnimator appears in a minuscule cameo at the very beginning of the film

1	This one and Her Pilgrim Soul are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of Twilight Zone As I mentioned in my comment on the new series theres something lacking in this new series Maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned Its a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than Serlings version However this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too I think the appeal is that no matter what they do the lovers can never unite I remember I wasnt surprised by the Korean movie Il Mare later remade into The Lake House I think its because I saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film

0	Lets see where to begin bad acting Im not sure if Id even call it that as it more along the lines of a noeffort script read The actors didnt even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless Sure there was a scene or two with nudity but that couldnt save this movie from its lifeless charactersbr br To call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do The lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rantsbr br Budget Did this movie even have a budget It seemed like they used less money than Ive seen in a homeshot YouTube video Bad lighting props poor sound post production Bad special effects if you want to go so far as to call them that Story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so but there was no life to this flick I dont care who directed itbr br Ive seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom Dont waste your time or youll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review Check the ratings youll see the 1s are rapidly outpacing the fluffed 10s with hardly anything in between Wish I would have looked a little closer before wasting my time What a suckfest
0	Would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball This movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level In this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp He is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra This movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world the acting was awful and I think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it
0	This film is mediocre at best Angie Harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers Her bitchy demeanor from Law and Order carries over in a failed attempt at comedy Charlie Sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anticomedy The only positive thing to come out of this mess is Charlie and Denises marriage Hopefully that effort produces better results

0	This is a kind of genre thing meaning you either like the 1950s musicals or you dont If you do youll love this Personally I prefer the 1930s and most of the 40s musicals with the dancing talents of Astaire and Rogers and Eleanor Powell Bill Robinson Ruby Keeler James Cagney Shirley Temple and so forth but the songs of the 50s the slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all turn me offbr br This film is a caseinpoint The first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me By then the story didnt have much appeal either The presence of Deborah Kerr is another minus I dont think Ive seen a movie she starred in that I liked including this one where the goody twoshoes English teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave Siam I which she had br br However divorcing myself from likesanddislikes there is no denying this Rogers and Hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many folks particularly those who liked The Sound Of Music a decade later There are similarities in the RH musicals Thus if you liked the Julie Andrews flick you should like this too br br This is a Lavish production with yes a capital L This is the kind of bigproduction musicals you rarely saw after that generation You also get the dubbed singers unlike today where the actress isnt able to really sing so Marnie Nixon comes to rescue of Kerr as she did with Natalie Wood in West Side Story and Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady br br Yul Brynner is King Mongkut and is the stereotypical traditionalist the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way He isnt progressive as the left wingers like the say but the education teacher Kerr as Anna Leonowens will set him straight Secularprogressives of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer However Yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his morebarkthanbite character Justifiably he is the big star of this film Brynner had magnetism Even in The Magnificent Seven Yul was the one cowboy who mesmerized the audiencebr br In summary its a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it Ill leave it at that
1	This is a family film which to some people is an automatic turn off It seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded down with failing arms and legs gratuitous violence and enough expletives to fill the New York phone book This film is none of those It is cliché it is formula but it is also fun It doesnt ask you to think it doesnt demand that you accept the film as reality It simply does what a good film ought to do which is to willingly suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure The cast is good while not excellent As another commenter pointed out the John Williams sound score was as usual excellent And the fact that a lot of the film was shot in Huntsville at the real space camp made it even more believable br br It was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for some months due to the Challenger Shuttle disaster which may have played a large part in its original theatrical opening but the film eventually has helped to focus the dreams of many young people back towards space and the possibilities that lie therein SO sit back with your kids and prepare to enjoy
1	Ah I loved this movie I think it had it all It made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times Yes I am a girl so Im writing this from a girls perspective I think its a shame it only scored 52 in rating Too many guys voting It was far above other romantic comedies Just because Im female I dont enjoy all chic flicks on the contrary I prefer other genres Romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be But like I said this movie had it all almost in my opinion Great script good oneliners fine acting Although Eva Longoria Parkers character reminded very much of Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives but so what It was awesome I will keep this film for rainy days days when I feel low and need a few laughs
1	The Thief of Bagdad is a treasure First and foremost it is a good story Though my four childrens primary exposure to this tale the most famous of the stories of the Arabian Nights comes from the Disney Corporation the Thief of Bagdad held their interest to the end The story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability Sabu who plays the young thief Abu also measures up to any of todays teen actors in appeal judging from the number of times I heard my oldest daughter say Hes cute br br In 1940 the film won Oscars for cinematography and special effects Today of course those effects seem very dated Look its Barbie flying through the air declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying Yet they fit into the story well The film is after all over 60 years old The effects fit with the script Furthermore what ones sees in The Thief of Bagdad remained pretty much stateoftheart for the next twentyfive years One need only compare the opening montage from a 1967 Star Trek episode to see this In that it was quite an achievementbr br This qualifies as a family film though there are a few stabbings near the end The acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animationbr br All in all a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment or for the historical value of the effects I recommend it
1	Radiofreccia is a movie about all of us about our dreams our friends our obsessions our addictions our fears It is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century The movie doesnt take a happy or sad approach on things it just tells us a story one that all of us could have experienced One of happiness and excitement sadness and grief The power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again feeling closer to the little town in Emilia Romagna where it takes place Hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to Freccia and his friends listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing Radio Raptus International playing their dreams our dreams Radiofreccia will make you laugh it will make you cry at times it will shock you and comfort you it will give you and take from you Personally I believe it to have played an important part in my life and that of my friends and I suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours

1	When I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1995 via a free advanced screening I was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it I was sorry when I talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended I on the other hand felt completely the opposite I was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else People I talked to said there was too much talking Plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters I found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the American moviegoing public seems to have a tendency to want easytofollow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused They also like to be spoonfed tidy endingshappy OR sad This disgusts me Nobody wants to be challenged anymore And as for the ending and I dont want to be a spoiler I am totally content because I know in my heart that these two characters WILL see each other again Its all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny Its a very personal film that doesnt speak to all people But it certainly spoke to me Give it a chance Be patient with it Richard Linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of Vienna Watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters As if you yourself were tripping through Europe on a Eurail pass Its very intimate Plus Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life They must have improvised during some parts and it works well They have a great chemistry in their roles Their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses I get the feeling that this was a very personal work for Mr Linklater and I deeply respect him for getting this film made It definitely touched me and I hope it touches others just as much Bravo for romance
1	This film has good characters with excellent performances from the cast David Strathairn is diabolically sincere as the child molesting salesman and Danny Vinson plays a perfect pussywhipped southern husband The slick soundtrack betrays the murder ballad tone of the film
1	The legendary Boris Karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in Mexico This is the token moody period Gothic horror entry from the bunch Karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as Matthias Morteval an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty greedy and backbiting nocount relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will Pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal lifesized toy people who populate the place Onetime Mexican sex symbol Andres Garcia of Tintorera infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and Julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character The clunky plodding nondirection trite bythenumbers script ugly washedout cinematography ridiculous murder set pieces a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon overwrought string score morbid gloomdoom atmosphere largely lousy acting Karloff notably excepted cheesy mild gore poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm A real campy hoot
0	This was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store Dont make the same mistake I did This movie is tedious unconvincingly acted and generally boring The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered I cringed at every scene they shared Dennis Hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self his role was clearly not a stretch for him And although the movie is supposedly set in Puerto Rico it feels a lot more like a Hollywood movie lot all of the main characters are Caucasian and several tend to speak English with pseudoIrish accents Odd Anyway when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store keep walking
0	1st watched 1262009 4 out of 10 DirWalter Lang Disappointing musical from a character development standpoint in my opinion from this muchheralded Rodgers and Hammerstein piece There a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal at times of the King of Siam by Yul Brynner but the movie doesnt really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings I can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we dont fully understand the characters and their situations I know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing but even this part didnt stand out a lot for me The basic storyline is about an English woman coming to Siam to teach the children about upscale European things We find out later that the King is actually the biggest pupil There is a side forbidden romance between the Kings newest wife played by Rita Morenoa latino as an Arabcome on and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really mesmerizing added though Deborah Kerr as the main female character Annie is OK but not that convincing either The King learns some things because of her presence and then the movie fades away as he does This is really a miniscule story with some songs and dancing but not that great of an experience for a viewer really

1	Having seen most of Ringo Lams films I can say that this is his best film to date and the most unusual Its a ancient china period piece cranked full of kickass martial arts where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters The action is fantastic the story is tense and entertaining and the set design is truely memorable Sadly Burning Paradise has not been made available on DVD and vhs is nexttoimpossible to get your mitts on even if you near the second biggest chinatown in North America like I do If you can find it dont pass it up

0	I saw the film at the Belgrade Film Festival last week and Im still working off the trauma Essentially my view seems to match a number of others the first half hour was fresh sharp deep entertaining and promising Well acted too Natural My problem however is not simply with the fact that the final hour and a half of the film have nothing to do with the likable beginning nor the fact that I spent most of this time convulsing in agony at sharp grating industrial sounds and squinting at drunken toothless breadchewing hags Its rather with the fact that THEY NEVER WARNED ME The festival brochure synopsis described only the utterly intriguingsounding first half hour a whore piano tuner and meat seller chat in a bar pretending to be an advertising agent genetic engineer and petty government administration official respectively making no mention whatsoever of the neverending gumsmacking to come Serves me right for not reading the reviews you might say but to my defense a number of reviews I looked at postfact um didnt at all stress the immensity and utter unbearableness of the greater part of the filmbr br The first hint should have been the introductory words by the director a bashful touslehaired Russian youth who stepped in front of the crammed auditorium the film seems to be doing incredibly well critically and tickets were sold out well in advance of the screening though most of the audience seemed as unaware as I was of the pain to come judging by the plethora of unearthly moans and groans that utterly permeated the theatre during the last half hour and many exasperated comments on exit to say the following Well I um thank you very much for coming to see this film and I just wanted to say well its a very long film it took me four years to make it and its I suggest that you see it and immediately try to forget about it It is very long Thank you for coming This is what he said Alarm bells should have been ringing Whats he talking about I thought in happy confusion This is gonna be fun Of course by the time his strangely apologetic comments started making sense to me it was far too late to get out All I could do is writhe in increasing agony until the lights came on again And in the end I cant say I feel in any way improved by the experience Yes I absolutely loved the first half hour It was intelligent new and had a lot to say And yes Russia is probably in a bad state Yes every society has many hidden faces Yes toothless life in barren wastelands is probably unimaginably hard Yes yes yes I get all of this Really I do But I see no earthly reason why art and meaning should be so agonisingly drawn out and so painful to bear If you want to see a film land somewhere between the extremes of glitzy Hollywood plastic fantastic and hours of muddy vodka swigging try the KoreanChinese Bin Jip 3Iron Its artsy and surprising but also tothepoint and fun
1	Japanese Tomo Akiyamas Keko Mask 1993 is extremely enjoyable trash film and so fun to watch There are also some sequels but I havent seen them since these films are hyper rare Some kind of rereleases some day would be nice since I think many trash lovers would like these films The tongue in cheek story is about one extremely strict school in which teachers think that it is okay to torture students in order to attain discipline which is according to the teachers the most important thing in education The school is lead by incredibly funny looking just look at the costume human wizardwhatever who is like principal in the school and it only adds to the campiness that it is never explained why he wears such a costume since all other teachers are perfectly normally clothed Well the main thing about the film is its name Keko Mask who is some beautiful and masked fairy who comes always to save the girls and students who are abused and tortured by the teachers Yes this superheroine is one effective female as she kicks and fights the evil teachers with totally cheesy soundtrack playing on the background The most important thing is of course that she wears nothing but a cape and a mask with the rest of her body naked Her identity is never revealed in these films and also the credits say Keko Mask Unknown while the actor names are listedbr br The most hilarious thing in this film is how Keko Mask kills her enemies She has a gorgeous but lethal vagina Yes you read right She kills her victims by flying in the air in front of them spreading her legs and letting the enemies become numbly charmed of the view after which she flies closer and snaps their necks with her legs The most usual last line the characters say in this film are like Ive never seen such a beautiful vagina and Now I can die in peace This film is totally fantasticbr br There are also some great taunts towards Japanese society for example its attitude towards sex in films Japanese censors optically fogblur all the pubic hair in any film and also about some restrictions among school students like girls and boys are not allowed to talk in this film etc Theres one great scene in which one nerd sees girls bare youknowwhat for the first time and says Hey theres no fog in it I couldnt help but laugh during this scene as I thought what do the Japanese censors think about this Also one character says in the end that he will return if Japan Films allows to make the sequel Im glad it allowed as Ive heard the sequels are equally outrageous One sequel should include Blues Brothers yes THOSE Blues Brothers in it etcbr br This is trash in its most enjoyable funniest and also cleverest form and so it is a little shame these films are so hard to find This would definitely be even greater experience if it was little more fast moving at times as it becomes little boring at one point but fortunately those segments are very few This film has to be seen to be fully believed as there are so many trash elements I dont mention here and it wouldnt be even necessary to tell them all here If you like trash cinema and films made with tongue in very cheek I think youll love this little gem as I do and the director is definitely a genius in this field 810 Perhaps the only film in which a shining vagina is this lethal

0	Sadlythis is not the best British gore film since hellraiser though the DVD cover claims this which is what tricked me into buying it It is however an homage to many of the great horrors of old films from most notably the Amicus stablebr br Cradle is shot on mini dv which though we all know has more of a TV feel than a movie can be done so much better Every scene set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way standard key fill rear setup which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece The gore content is quite frankly laughable From the opening shots where we see a mans obviously foam rubber head torn apart through to tacky cheap prop hammers the creature effects and the terrible cg there was nothing in there that impressed me at allbr br The acting is abominable from the nearcomatose detective to the brummie dwarf via Dani Filth the least convincing horror movie bad guy I have ever witnessed Each of the substories is more formulaic than the last and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs Look out for the Mental Asylum a Georgian semi detached house with a bad cg sign outside and the most bizarre and not in a good way padded cell I have seenbr br It took me four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering nay running away at any available opportunity I actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was runningbr br It does however mark one of the last known appearances of Emily Booths breasts which I guess is one um two things it has going for it Once thats out of the way though it is all downhillbr br Ive heard people say good things about Alex Chandon and I would love to believe them but on this evidence Im not likely to If you want a decent homage to Amicus avoid this and go for the League of Gentlemen Christmas special insteadbr br Currently battling it out with Blair Witch 2 Book of Shadows for the title of worst film I have ever seen
1	Before Sunrise has many remarkable things going on almost too many to fit into one review like this but its suffice to say that its one of the most observant character studies of the nineties maybe even in all of contemporary cinema to be observant not about love persay so much as its about a human connection How does one fall in love at first sight No one does at least thats deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film And yet there is the possibility of as intense a connection of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna and on the way there start to talking about things at first arbitrary then personal Jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the town in Vienna until his plane the next morningbr br Before Sunrise gives Jessie and Celine in the midst of the gorgeous Vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance and in a sense is about the act of having conversations of what its like to watch people having one leading into another and another Here its often about relationships and commitments as Jessie and Celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential or seemingly so and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities We hear confessions of desires for other loves or what werent really loves of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how youll love your life of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul I loved the bit about the quakers in the church and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism Jessie may be more responsible for that last part but whats fascinating about the film is that its never exactly cynical itself just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their livesbr br Meanwhile its always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in these roles where theyre not incessantly annoying in that 90s GenerationX mode but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film which isnt a bad one at all but a necessary one one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other where sweet asides are actually acceptable I have to tell you a secret Jessie says and then leans in for a kiss hoho or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way I loved the scene with the poet where its very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal or with the palm reader and how the reactions from Jessie and Celine are that we might share but really are seeing them do it firsthand All the while Hawke and Delpy embody the roles interestingly we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives as it may lead off into the futurebr br Featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness however selfcontained as it may lead into something more Whos to say you cant suddenly be attached to someone if only for less than 24 hours and be that much more attached than a married couple This is perhaps Linklaters thesis but theres more to it than just that Its a very dense film and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly One scene especially which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking on the phone in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the others friend A
0	As an impressionable 10 year old I liked the love conquers all philosophy of the 70s sitcom Bridget Loves Bernie I did understand the controversy which was about the romantic complications between a Jewish cab driver David Birney and an Irish Catholic school teacher Meredith Baxter and both sets of parents Harold J Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernies parents Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridgets parents who have issues with the young couples interfaith marriagebr br Looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences I am amazed that the show was even a success for one albeit highlyrated season Created by veteran TV writer Bernard Slade who a few years after the shows cancellation would write the successful play Same Time Next Year Bridget Loves Bernie was a very light superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weightbr br There was no denying the reallife chemistry between Birney and Baxter But in later years both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects Birney in his shortlived role in St Elsewhere and Baxter in Family and Family Ties Here they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subjectbr br The show aired Saturday nights between two CBS powerhouses All in the Family and Mary Tyler Moore Both of those shows were smart funny and had enough of an edge more so on the former that the latter that kept my interest in the situation and the characters Bridget Loves Bernie was not very smart and only had some occasional chucklesbr br This was another example of a show that really was not as good as I remembered
0	A horribly pointless and worse boring film Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way br br Will Ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to Jim Careys Truman Show and substitutes his usual shouting routine admittedly very funny if you discount Talledega Nights for well pretty much nothing br br Emma Thompson is no more than mildly irritating that some reviews Ive read here are talking her up for an Oscar nomination is laughable whilst Maggie Gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of Harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy Please That she ended up falling for Ferrells character is utterly ludicrousbr br Marc Forsters attempts to jazz up the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired the material he has to work withbr br I had the choice of either going to watch The Prestige for the third time or seeing this I wish Id opted for The Prestige
0	Warner Bros made many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast paced economical and very entertaining I really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life This is one of Warners few hardedged melodramas that simply doesnt work Edward G Robinson plays a ruthless editor of newspaper who resurrects the 20year old story of a murderess with tragic consequences Robinson gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that dont cut the mustard HB Warner Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good but the bad acting of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the second leads really hurts the movie Starr is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie In addition the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of precode Hollywood LeRoys direction is full of innovative visual touches but he cannot overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations Sol Politos camera work is strong Somehow this piece of dreck got an Oscar nomination for Best Picture in a year that gave us M Dracula and Frankenstein
1	This is an hilarious movie One of the very best things about it is the quality of the performance by each actor From the largest role to the smallest each character is vivid unforgettable and so understandable It can also make you laugh so hard your health will improve
1	I for one was glad to see Jim Carrey in a film where being over the top wasnt the goal His character is like all of us Wanting more better things to happen to us and expecting God to deliverbr br Morgan Freeman made a great God With a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itselfbr br I thought Jennifer Anistons character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards Carrys basically selfcentered TV anchorman wannabe but thats the way it was writtenbr br I think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happenedbr br I have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep This is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heartbr br A funny film
0	The plot for Descent if it actually can be called a plot has two noteworthy events One near the beginning one at the end Together these events make up maybe 5 of the total movie time Everything and I mean everything in between is basically the directors desperate effort to fill in the minutes I like disturbing movies I like dark movies and I dont get troubled by gritty scenes but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazydark literally scenes with NO storyline you have another thing coming Rosario Dawson one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here And no she doesnt get naked not even in the NC17 version which I sawbr br If you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch Descent take a nap instead youll probably have more interesting dreams

0	After watching this on the MST3K episode I have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from It seems to combine elements of Logans Run Farenheight 451 Final Sacrifice and at least several others At one point I was really expecting Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER br br I wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot like the fact that even though gas is unavailable there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations and the stations are located close enough together to keep an F1 race car going all the way across the country
0	I found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored How can people possibly give this a 10 Its not just that its supposed to be a feelgood redemption film I think because it doesnt work on that level either Weak plot bad dialogue terrible acting theres just nothing there Harvey Keitel is decent but has nothing to work with and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are just terrible The plot progression especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley makes no sense It seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow Its only an hour and a half but thats 90 minutes of your life youll never get back
0	At the beginning of the film you might doublecheck the DVD cover and reread the synopsis a couple of times but no worries Its NOT Memoirs of a Geisha that you purchased just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be Still the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie as it shows how in the year 1840 a Samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery He decapitates the two lovers before doing some harakiri ritual suicide through disembowelment Cut to present day when the American Ambassador in Japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago From then onwards this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional Lets start with the good aspects namely the original Japanese setting and the presence of the delicious Susan George who is my alltime favorite British horror wench well together with Britt Eckland Linda Hayden and Ingrid Pitt The bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter The restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff The spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into Susans ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress In this possessed state she even lures the American ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests So strictly spoken its not really evil that dwells in the house just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their longdead hands Obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening especially since the lightblue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in Ghostbusters The House Where Evil Dwells is probably the least scary ghost movie ever Throughout most of the running time youll be wondering whether director Kevin Connor who nevertheless made the excellent horror films Motel Hell and From Beyond the Grave intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and overthetop like Motel Hell maybe But then again everyone in the cast continues to speak hisher lines with a straight and sincere face so I guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed The House Where Evil Dwells is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesnt even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning I am fully aware of how shallow it sounds but the two scenes in which Susan George goes topless are the only true highlights Well those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously oversized spiders or are they crabs in the daughters bedroom How totally random and irrelevant was that If you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstepbr br Trivia note for horror buffs keep an eye open for the demonmask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant Japanese horror classic Onibaba
0	Awful Awful Awful No I didnt like it It was obvious what the intent of the film was to track the wheeling and dealing of the movers and shakers who produce a film In some cases these are people who represent themselves as other than what they are I didnt need a film to tell me how shallow some of the people in the film industry are I suppose Im at fault really because I expected something like Roman Holidaybr br Im not a moviemaker nor do I take film classes but it appeared to me that the film consisted of a series of twoshots in the main where the actors had been supplied with a loose plotline and they were to improvise the dialogue Henry Jaglon makes the claim that he along with Victoria Foyt actually wrote the screenplay but the impression was that the actors cognisant of the general direction of the film extemporised the dialogue and it was not always successful Such a case in point was when Ron Silver made some remark which really didnt flow along the line of the conversation and Im not going back to look for it and Greta Scacchi broke into laughter even though they were supposed to be having a serious conversation because Silvers remark was such a non sequitur You get the impression too that one actor deliberately tries to wrong foot the other actor and break hisher concentration Another instance of this is when a producer tells Silver to bring the documents 3 times Silver looked literally lost for words I have seen one other film which looked like a series of drama workshops on improvisation and that was awful toobr br The fact that Jaglon was able to attract Greta Scacchi no stranger to Australia Ron Silver Anouk Ami and Maximilian Schell suggests it was a slow news week for them Peter Bogdanovich had a whatthehellamIdoinghere look on his face at all times and I expected to hear him say Look Im a director and screenwriter not an actor which would have been unnecessary to state Faye Dunaway seemed more interested in promoting her son Liam Apart from the jerky delivery of the dialogue the handheld camera became irritating even if it was for verisimilitude as I suspect the natural dialogue was and the interest in the principals became subsumed to the interest in the various youths walking along the strand trying to insinuate themselves into shot That at least approached Cinema Verite So that along with the irritating French singing during which I used the mute button made for a generally disappointing 90odd minutesbr br I think we should avoid apotheosising films such as this Trying to see value in the film where it has little credit in order to substantiate a perceived transcendental level to it is misguided There was really nothing avantgarde about it It didnt come across as a work of art and yet it wasnt a documentary either I know it was a mocumentary but the real test is whether it is entertaining I was bored out of my skull It did have one redeeming feature it pronounced Cannes correctly so I gave it 310

0	Flight Of Fury is a shockingly dire but worst of all boring Action Film I dont expect a lot from a Seagal Film all I expect is to be moderately entertained for 90 or so minutes with some mindless action unfortunately this doesnt even achieve that low expectation The action scenes are few and far between the plot which is totally irrelevant in these Films is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot holes throughout The acting is truly abysmal bordering on embarrassing with Seagal and his whispering One expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of 3rd raters I find it hard to believe that anything close to 12M was spent on this dire mess unless 11M of that 12 was Seagals Salary I somehow doubt it The one moment of any interest to Straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that Its mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the Michael Dudikoff BMovies Ive enduredbr br 110
0	Though Frank Loessers songs are some of the finest that Broadway has to offer theyre bollixed by Joseph L Mankiewicz lethargic staging and uninspired presentationwhen its over it barely feels like youve watched a musical Mankiewicz doesnt seem to know how to present Loessers challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect for example one of the best numbers the showstopping Adelaides Lament concludes by having Adelaide Vivian Blaine belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge and Stubby Kayes fauxspiritual Sit Down Youre Rockin The Boat has his backing choir sitting in folding chairs while he simply stands there Mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue adapted from Abe Burrows stage book has none of the wit that his films like All About Eve have Part of the blame has to go to the leads just about all of whom are miscast Marlon Brando looks bewildered as to why hes in a musical Frank Sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential the songs are not tailored to his style and Jean Simmons barely registers the way a Shirley Jones might Only Blaine as the lovelorn showgirl Adelaide commands our attention like a Broadway pro should The colorful art direction is by Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol created the flashy sets
0	The film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional Japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads KUSHIATA KYOTO JAPAN 1840 A young Japanese trainee Samurai named Masanori Toshiya Maruyama walks up the winding path to the house inside waits Otami Mako Hattori with whom he is having an affair behind her husband Shugoros Tsuiyuki Sasaki as Toshiyuki Sasaki back who happens to be Masanoris teacher Shugoro unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other His honour destroyed the enraged Samurai brutally murders both Otami and Masanori before committing suicide Over a century later and Ted Fletcher Edward Albert arrives in Japan on a working holiday with his wife Laura Susan George and their young daughter Amy Amy Barrett Their close friend Alex Curtis Doug McClure who works for the American consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay you dont need me to you where He jokingly says its going so cheap because its haunted to which both Ted and Laura laugh off as they obviously dont believe in ghosts at least for the time being that is Almost immediately the film goes into cliché mode Lights turn on and off by themselves Laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local Zen Monk Henry Mitowa gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before its too late which they ignore of course The spirits of Otami Masanori and Shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a Majyo witches Tsuyako Olajima curse put upon them But there may be a way they can break the curse unfortunately for the Fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage daughter and possibly even their very lives br br Directed by Kevin Connor I thought this was a pretty average film OK to watch once if youve got nothing better to do but after a day or two youll probably have completely forgotten it Nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand theres nothing particularly good about the film either The script by Robert Suhosky from the novel by James Hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly bythenumbers a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction doesnt help things There are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic crabs that try to get Amy and her babysitter Noriko Mayumi Umeda And there is a scene where the Zen Monk exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished outside unable to get back in however that is until Ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in some exorcism One more thing I think it was a bad idea to have Doug McClure who was 47 when he made this try his hand at KungFu and oriental sword fighting George gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very unerotic sex scene with McClure although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensure no below the waist nudity was present Apart from a couple of mostly off screen decapitations theres no blood gore or violence to speak about The transparent ghost effects are OK but they aint going to impress many people these days Its professionally enough made and looks quite nice but the potential in the Japanese setting and myths is squandered as this film could have been set in America England or any Western country without having to change a thing An OK time waster
1	I went into this film thinking it would be a crappy brated movie I came out surprised and very amused Eva was good but Lake Bell stole the show She had amazing comedic timing The jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between The plot was enough to tie it all together a woman Eva dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her wastobe husband its sounds farfetched but it actually works quite well br br 710 Overall its a worthwhile cinema watch if not get it on DVD when it comes out

0	The premise is amazing and the some of the acting notably Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp is charming but this film is near unwatchable The music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap Most of the singing is offkey I think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it The dialogue is really stupid and trite The movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical subplots I found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering when is it ever going to end

1	I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1 Richard Dean Anderson 2 Amanda Tapping These two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors The replacement of RDA in seasons 910 was enough to take the heart out of the showbr br The chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous You get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling This relationship carries over into the program we get to seebr br RDA gives his ONeill character believable personality He never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest You watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances Still they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilousbr br There is a lot going on between Carter and ONeill under the surface They manage to keep the lid on but often just barely The episode Solitudes in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television The love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it togetherbr br Carter and Jackson often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by ONeill Yet ONeills tactical instincts always seem sound He understands what to do without having to think about the matter The team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his ordersbr br The quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10 The original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest Ben Browder was far inferior to RDA in carrying the show He had his rare moments with Claudia Black but that was all Amanda Tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons You could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby She was probably thinking more about the child than the showbr br The spinoff Stargate Atlantis has a few moments but is mostly a weaker effort The major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original The villains Wraiths are so improbable as to be ludicrous Maybe Amanda Tapping can breathe some life into the program or it wont last beyond the fourth seasonbr br There has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show To have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in SciFi The use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad The campy use of decor from ancient Egypt concealing ultramodern technology is just as hard to acceptbr br I wondered about some of the continuity on the show too In the season 2 opener Daniel Jackson is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded He crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet The episode Hathor has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the SGC yet it is never mentioned again This device could have been used in several later episodes on Daniel ONeill and Dr Frasier
1	Despite a tight narrative Johnnie Tos Election feels at times like it was once a longer picture with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved Some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel Election 2 Harmony is a Virtue but its still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested Triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions though not the violence in favour of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call Its also a film where the most ruthless character isnt always the most threatening one as the chilling ending makes only too clear one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystanderbr br Simon Yam all too often a variable actor but always at his best under Tos direction has possibly never been better in the lead not least because Tony Leungs much more extrovert performance makes his stillness more the powerful
1	Radiofreccia is still a good surprise in Italian cinema The film is based on a book of Italian songwriter Luciano Ligabue who also directs the movie and writes the music score of coursebr br The film is a portrait of north Italian province life in the Emilia Romagna region Were in 1975 the time of the first free radios one of the boys of the movie creates Radioraptus Youth wishes friendship love sex individual dramas and unemployment are among the themes but the film speaks also about drugs Freccia the main character is a victim of heroin slaverybr br Without being boring and moralist the story flows very well the spontaneity of actors is strong and the way of directing as well Obviously Luciano Liga Ligabue is neither Fellini nor a movie professional first of all hes a musician But he succeeds in making a good product Unfortunately hell not repeat the success with his second movie Da zero a dieci not good at allbr br In Radiofreccia actors are generally not very famous the only star is Stefano Accorsi one of the most popular young Italian actors See in a small role another Italian songwriter Francesco Guccini hes the nice communist barman and football trainer
0	OK so it was written in 1996 before 911 so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the CIA director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world is prescient Thats it Thats the good stuff The actingfair The plotsilly The twist unnecessary DOOOOOOOOOOOM It isnt as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated Dont you think bureaucrats have a manual for plagues and how to contain them Proper execution of such a plan is always a problem as we saw after Katrina But they have a plan It isnt to send them off to Iceland and then to Mauritania And if the virus is carried in the air why was the plane door open and the shooters standing there with no protection In fact did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs That would stop her But not as dramatic Im a sucker I always watch a movie to see the end once I started it But this was a waste of time and for the most part predictable I saw it using a recorder so I didnt have to watch all the ads that was a plus Its a good example of why I watch so little network TV Rubbish

1	This has to be one of the most sincere and touching boymeetsgirl movies ever made While Rebel Without a Cause and Say Anything deliver nice portrayals this movies strips down useless subplots and Hollywood divergences This movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance You never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people You almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between Jesse and Celine and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it This movie is mostly all dialogue based But every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is How in all that conversation while often having no real bearing on anything critical you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other This is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone And what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe This could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random And what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of Vienna in which this film takes place It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests And no matter how many times I watch this film I dont think I will ever tire of that
1	I saw a trailer for this on Afro Promo the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring AfricanAmericans It looked like what it is a highly tendentious wacky comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay It would seem that Redd Foxxs RF wife has left him for his brother who works with him at the store back in Phoenix He has taken the bus to visit his son Norman is Los Angelesbr br So as RF arrives Norman wearing nothing but powderblue bikini shorts gets out of his waterbed to answer the door Trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor Norman tries to wake his lover who steadfastly refuses to budge It was just to the point where I wrote WHY wont he wake up when suddenly he does and me and my friends jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blueeyed swirlhairdoed Garson Normans white livein lover who just had the most faaaaaabulous dream Garson is a flaming queen of a type that can ONLY be imagined as emerging from 1976 LA He has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on Carol Brady from The Brady Bunchbr br Norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his fathers visit Garson goes to stay with Waylon Flowers and Madam answers the phone when Norman calls br br So RF attempts to reach his wife in Mexico While he is on the phone Garson comes in to pack his dress and RF confronts him With a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation but sounding more like were about to hear a very special track by The Emotions he realizes that his son is gaybr br His first impulse is Ill kill him Ill kill him Then RF goes on a long walk wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have such as maybe we toilet trained him too soon His thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man Surprisingly he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality This it must be said is about eight more books on homosexuality than MY parents bought He then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all br br RF then hires Audrey a sixfoot Amazon prostitute in this amazing fur thing played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones He hired her for Norman to try out heterosexuality but this pisses Norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend Melodybr br Then Garson comes over and offers to take RF out for the night He commiserates over the loss of RFs wife and tells the tale of his own mother who harbors an irrational prejudice against Pilippinos because she was molested at a luau They attend a long featured performance of Wayon and Madam which culminates in Madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose Once more mouths were agapebr br So it seems that wouldnt ya just know it RF and Garson have a wonderful evening together You see staid traditional older black men just have to see the crappy highlyeffeminate entertainment of megaqueens in order to come around to ALL the gay world has to offer Its really JUST that simple This still does not prevent RF from yelling Rape when Garson wakes him from a bad dream It ends less predictably than youd thinkbr br There was so much that was just off WHAT is the basis of Norman and Garson s relationship They dont seem to have ANY rapport and Norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking Garson out and even when he comes around to stand up for himself he never defends Garson or talks about their relationship There were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like RF going to buy all those books on homosexualityand sitting right down on the park bench to read them I like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friendsbr br Other than that its kind of just what it seems like a little relic of a bygone era an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance we could all learn to love and understand one another And because of the whole naiveté of this thing the extreme stereotypes and messageladen dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past 30 years I guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays female friends are desperately in love with them and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with and by extension convert thembr br Hey check out Cinema de Merde my website on bad and cheesy movies with a few good movies thrown in You can find the URL in my email address above
1	This is a film for entertainment I did not think the world made social commentary from one small film I personally find this film funny audacious and memorable It is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a Princess This film was done very well I might add in the 70s a time of the best experiments in film with being able to mention a persons sexuality This movie is not about a person being homosexual or not it is however about love in all its strange forms This film does show some of the realities of being gay in the 70s in Hollywood or in California Pretty boys being looked after by older not so pretty men Women who had to stay deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career Bathhouses were an integral part of the gay communitybr br THEN the fantasy begins Let us mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what do we have Well this movie which in ANY way was better than that dismal redo The Next Big Thing Perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this movie and then try to do betterbr br I enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the 70s and it still brings a smile to my lips now I heartily advise anyone who wants a funny tender movie to curl up with some popcorn and have some fun Some people need to lighten up And this is the film you should do it withbr br

0	I caught this at a test screening All I can say is Whatthehell This movie plays out about as smoothly as Mickey Mouse reading the script for Scarface Its bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense and even if you do leave your brain in the car the film is still so bizarre that it isnt even funnybr br The plot involves crocodile hunter Steve Irwin trying to save a crocodile which contains a CIA probe The CIA comes after Irwin to get their probe back Irwin mistakes them for poachers and sets out to stop thembr br Thats about all the story there is the rest is overthetop lampooning of Australian culture Didja see dat and Crikey and strangely choreographed action sequences At one point Irwin mounts a speeding RV and knife fights with a CIA agent on top of it Yes thats right Steve Irwin knife fights a guy on top of an RV Let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film
1	It took us a couple of episodes to get into Dark Angel as a story and a series since we were transitioning from The Sopranos a very different mentality framework But once we got with the gist of the series we were very quickly hooked Its a shame that the series ended just when it was just starting to past good into the excellent category Dark Angelwas much more than your average TV series It kicks ass and rocks as far as action goes but the interactions of the characters and societal reactions to mutants reminds us of the constant prejudices that we face and make everyday That the story is set in the future keeps the mood surreal and prevents the antidiscrimination message from being rubbed in our faces hence not ruining the fun for those who dont like to be lectured during entertainment but every event and humansocietal interaction remains relevant to the present We all make judgments face our own prejudices but in the end the question of who you are lies in do you sit back and shut your mind to it or do you get up and do something about it For those who have no choice but to fight for survival or justice this series empowers them For those whove never had to face the question this series sneaks in that message under the guise of pure action entertainment It is much more wellmade and wellwritten than most TV series Im highly disappointed it ended before it could really kick into high gear

1	Being a giant monster fan me seeing Yeti was an absolute must especially after hearing so much about it Thanks to the good ol bootleg market I was able to find a copy pretty easily and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually dare I say decentbr br Decent for what it is actually namely a cheesy giantmonster flick It kicks in pretty quickly as Yeti is found pretty much immediately and we get introduced to various characters They consist of some sleazy ones some good ones and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy scifi film by farbr br Yeti looks like a longhaired guy straight out of the original Woodstock concert and really hes not that bad of a dude especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cagelike thing Godzilla he is not despite his rude awakening he doesnt even rampage actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out Yeti seems to understand English pretty nicely my copy was dubbed in English and he knows who the good guys and bad guys arebr br However we want to see the giant Yeti do his thing and hes pretty much in the whole movie and in typical lowbudget fashion he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and theres even a bunch of the fake legs shots of him just standing therebr br Yes the special effects arent the greatest but there are definitely some good ones here A scene where Yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well and in another he uses the windows of a building as ladder steps to climb down from the top of it shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside in one sequence that really looks much much better than it should in such a bad moviebr br Yeti never stoops as low as say APE does Actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes Yetis nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an oh yeah baby manner But even this isnt that bad and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewerbr br The movie is pretty long for this kind of thing but surprisingly enough it doesnt get boring the story is actually good and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happybr br Yeti may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks but it is definitely better than other King Kong 76 ripoffs like APE and Queen Kong by very far
1	The Haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house good effects work and sound work a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house There are scenes that make you jump and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past I found interesting There are genuinely creepy moments in the film and I liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets curtains and the house itself Jerry Goldsmiths score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you What I wish couldve happened is for something a little more intense Jan De Bont had a PG13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago and it still holds up The Haunting couldve used a few more scenes of pure terror The ending was for me a little anticlimactic Overall I enjoyed it The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump I just wish it scared me more
0	I had no idea what the film is about before I saw it because Tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that It is the directorial debut of Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote the screenplays for Dhoom 1 2 and Saif Ali Khans son Ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashbackbr br After watching it I understood that why their wasnt a proper trailer because there wasnt anything in the film to show The story was extremely dum and even a 10 year old child can come up with a better storyline There was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and its difficult to figure out that who is killing who Also the action was daft unrealistic eg 1 man with a handgun managed to kill about 100 men with machine gunsbr br While I was watching Tashan it reminded me of 3 filmsbr br Sin City During the opening creditsbr br Koyla Anil Kapoors terrible English like Amrish Puri in Koylabr br Jhoom Barabar Jhoom The outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funnybr br I also heard the budget is 40 crores which is the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I dont know where all the money went to Anyway if you did not like Dhoom 2 then there is absolutely no chance that you will like Tashan Race was hot on heels and that is a million times betterbr br The only 2 good songs are Dil Haara Challiya and both songs are shot in Greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film Even Anil Kapoors terrible English couldnt save this discomfiture

0	This was an atrocious waste of my time No plot The acting was so far below par it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what NOT to do It is merely a commercial ripoff of the earlier Universal Soldier which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel Its sad that VD needs to assert his ego every few years and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it This kind of schlock gives Martial Arts movies a bad name By comparison it makes Segall Norris and Arnold look almost talentedbr br Perhaps VD should take the Leslie Nielson track and do sendups of his genre At least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him

1	We watched this in my Womens Health Issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies and I absolutely loved this movie I plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch The story is very touching and I would recommend it to anyone I am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what I needed This is a movie for the whole family despite its rating This is a movie I will show to my children The professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women but this movie was more than that It is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite
1	The Haunted World of Edward D Wood Jr is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as Glen or Glenda Bride of the Monster and of course Plan 9 from Outer Space This exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries such as Look Back in Angora and The Plan 9 Companion failed It rounds up his surviving entourage many of whom have passed away since filming and gives an honest examination of Ed Wood and his work Nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear Hollywood sentimental in its treatment of the director down to the haunting music this documentary is an absolute mustsee for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day The entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together Eds life and untimely death for the viewer Best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater
1	Simply put this is the best movie to come out of Michigan since well ever Evil Dead eat your heart out Hatred of A Minute was some of the oddest and best cinema to be seen by this reviewer in a long time I recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of a head trip or a good case of the willies
1	The Road Rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the Master to fight crime around the world The show was hilarious to say the least Simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages Running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game The action was mesmerizing and cleverly set up The characters were very original each with a very different personality But what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters Each of them have struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed but implied in subtext Hopefully one day therell be some way to watch the Rovers in action again
1	This movie was nominated for best picture but lost out to Casablanca but Paul Lukas beat out Humphrey Bogart for best actor I dont see why Lucile Watson was nominated for best supporting actor i just dont think she did a very good job Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three kids are leaving Mexico and coming into the United States in the first scene of the movie They are going by train to Daviss relatives house Davis and Lukas were in the underground to stop the Nazis so they are very tired and need rest But when they arrive home their is a Nazi living there and theirs not much either can do about it It turns out the Nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with Lukas Their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself
1	My roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her Shes from China and only heard so much about 911 and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary I felt awful watching this documentary it was like reliving the nightmare and it still brings tears to my eyesbr br But Im extremely grateful that I watched this documentary because on the day of September 11th Im sure we all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard all of us could only think certain questions Why How Whats going on Oh my God Almost all the Americans were grateful for the brave firemen and policemen that risked their lives to save others But I dont think we thought about what they were really going though This wasnt actually supposed to be a documentary about 911 the cameraman was just filming a typical day on the job and they just happened to be a couple blocks away from the World Trade Centers and got everything outside and in on tapebr br On Sep 11th I thought to myself Its OK the policemen and firemen will get the people out that survived To be honest I thought it was an accident I was in my junior year of high school and getting changed from gym and getting ready to go to my science class Someone came into the locker room shouting Some building just got bombed in New York we all got dressed quickly and ran to our classrooms as we watched the first tower burning on TV Not only 15 seconds later live on TV does the second plane crash into the other World Trade Center and we knew this was no accident A few minutes later we heard about the Pentagon and that there was a plane headed for Chicago but was shot down So many thoughts ran through our heads and I kept on thinking What are the firemen and policemen going to do But its procedure to them I thought theyll know what to dobr br The first tower collapsed we knew it so many lives are now gone the second tower crashed things would never be the same Those firemen in this documentary showed courage confusion and strength the real raw human emotions They didnt know what to do they were just as scarred as those other people who were in the towers They heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows And here I was in a classroom just crying seeing all that was going on on TV I was amazed with this film and just wanted to go to New York and tell them how grateful all the Americans were for their help I know they feel like they were just doing their job but they did more they were heros Every day after Sep 11th for 3 weeks they kept on digging knowing that there were no survivors but they kept on hoping and praying May God bless their kind and brave heartsbr br As for my roommate she was crying and admitted this was her first time crying at these attacks She got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day She asked Why I didnt know what to say it breaks my heart that people can be that evil It sounds clique but it was a normal day for everyone one of the firemen said in the documentary No one expected this to happen Not like that those people in the World Trade Centers or the Pentagon or the planes that were hijacked they were just doing their job happen to be there or even just was there for a second passing by They were not just murdered they were slaughtered and those hijackers did it with a song in their heart Then seeing in the middle east all the people celebrating why do people do this They celebrated death and the lose of mothers fathers sisters brothers friends grandparents aunts uncles cousins etc Why br br So thanks to those people for making this documentary You truly think about the firemen policemen and the troops in Iraq and it keeps your hope up that there are good people in this world Thank you to all those people you are our heroesbr br 1010
0	This is not a film you can really analyse separately from its production The audience became the filmmakers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the American film industry we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend How is it possible to be objective This is our movie isnt it Or is it There may be nothing more disingenuous than a filmmaker who promotes himself as the audiences friend giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them Just look at that prime selfpublicist Eli Roth promising gorehounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like Hostelbr br David R Ellis may not have spawned the monster that was the internet response to his film but he was quite understandably quick to engage with it He took the carnivalhuckster school of filmmaking to a new level getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy So many have enthused over this interactive democratic approach to filmmaking that they seem to have missed the point that this is the most cynical form of filmasmarketing Nothing is included that the filmmakers know the fans wont buy and any old suggestion that will get bums on seats is incorporated The fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to knowbr br Isnt this just the evolution of the focus group approach Individual creativity talent craft ideas all are sacrificed before the inane chatter of the masses Its a critical commonplace that focus groups and test screenings dont make for good movies why should the preemptive intervention of internet enthusiasts be any different Because we happen to be film fans Well thank god for us because otherwise I might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snakebr br So yes I had fun at the movie a midnight showing fresh from the pub and with a bucket of icecream but it actually had relatively little to do with the film and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere Like Christmas everyone seemed determined that they would have fun no matter what There was laughter but I dont know if it was with the film or at the film With a film as calculated as this one is that even a meaningful distinction There are some genuinely good aspects to the film Samuel L Jackson gives a welljudged performance pure selfparody but with a real sense of pleasure Rachel Blanchard and Lin Shaye are decent in limited roles and there are one or two inspired moments the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulatebr br The stock characters are to be expected but the total lack of suspense isnt Whats the point of a film that combines two great phobias if theres no creeping menace There are several snakejumpsout moments but theyre incredibly badly staged Only the annoying British man gets a decent pulpy death scene the other killings are oddly flat The demise of the honeymoon couple for instance is shamefully botched Most of the actors fail to make an impression its a shame that a charismatic actress like Julianna Margulies should seem so tired when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a rollercoaster she could be talking to the audience the film falls far shortbr br There are worse movies but there are many many better another reviewer on this site compared this film with Lake Placid and its as apt a contrast as any I can think of That film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent the jokes were funny the suspense sequences were scary and it wasnt devised by committee That the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus I dont need a postpub midnight showing to have a good time with that filmbr br This film will in time fade to become a mere footnote in film history If it sets a precedent however Im genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time In all probability nothing much will come of it Perennial popcorn favourites Raiders of the Lost Ark Alien Halloween and of course Star Wars just arent produced by groupthinkbr br In the mean time Ill tell you what I havent half got a craving for some Ingmar Bergman
0	A huge disappointment from writer Hamm and director Dante Their previous collaboration on the first seasons Homecoming was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways This poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered The supposed payoff showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing If the point of the story was an extraterrestrial cleaning of the planet of its human infestation why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion Why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la Stephen Kings The Stand instead of having the male population butcher the females I kept hoping the episode would improve as I kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous The religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear Sam Hamm must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it I like a lot of both Dante and Hamms work but this was just unwatchable
0	If there is one film which is the worst of this year its TASHAN The first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring Dhoom 2 style film and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe Because of it being a Yashraj film Or maybe seeing the cheesy promo But this film gave me a shock it was even worst then Dhoom 2 and what i expected First Saifs introduction which is boring Then Saif Kareena meet Kareena is so artificial and then Anil Kapoor oh god what he is doing in such a weird film What kinda role it is What acting is he doing His first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts Then came Akshay who provided some nice scenes but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff Childhood romance overdose of childish Rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes The ending is another jokebr br Vijay Krishna Acharya would have got 3 films more to direct if this film had worked thats the strategy of yashraj only money nothing else So Vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers Music Vishal Shekhar is ordinarybr br Performances Akshay Kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air he actually provides some engaging moments Saif Ali Khan is irritating Kareena is equally bad Anil Kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more Rest are okay
0	The only reason I didnt score this a one is that Sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film It is a technically adept filmbr br That having been said this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven Most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program rather than actual fact And Sibrels irrefutable proof that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanicsbr br I do not recommend watching this but if you do see it at google video for free Dont let Bart Sibrel profit from your curiosity
0	This ambitious film suffers most from writerdirector Paul Thomas Andersons delusions of grandeur Highly derivative of much better material Altmans Nashville Lumets Network this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere A couple of misguided detours along the way an embarrassing musical interlude a biblical plague dont help matters Neither does the uneven level of performances Especially bad William H Macy whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether Julianne Moore for her unconvincing angst And how many times must we see John C Reillys Sad Sack shtick Chicago and The Hours will suffice Tom Cruise comes off well by comparison  his misogynist foulmouthed Holy Roller was rather amusing Speaking of foul mouths the script was so loaded with F bombs they lost their impact in no time Dont even talk about that awful soundtrack full of insipid and annoying vocals by Aimee Mann Her extended rendition of One a maudlin number to begin with drove me to distraction at the start of the film I should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours by which time Id been pushed to the brink of hell One redeeming feature which I havent seen mentioned in other reviews is the best performance in the bunch by unknown Melora Walters in the role of Claudia the damaged coke fiend bent on selfdestruction Her credibility exceeded all others by far This film took itself way too seriously and just didnt know when to end
1	I would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 vote if Claudia Black had not continued on in it Her inclusion as the silly Vela has brought the series down in my estimation To bring her in as a regular at the same time as including Ben Browder to replace RDA was a mistakebr br Unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of Jack and really didnt need this great series turned into new episodes of Farscapebr br I was a great fan of the film Stargate and when the series was first announced I had reservations that it could live up to the film but after watching the first episode I have to admit I was hooked I have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation
1	Sisters in law will be released theatrically on march 24th in Sweden A good occasion for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary It was shown in Göteborg together with a retrospective dedicated to Kim Longinotto director in focus of the festival She gave a master class very much appreciated telling about her method as documentary filmmaker and told the audience about the special circumstances which led her to shoot Sisters in law twice the first version got lost for good so a second shooting was organized and the film turned out to be different at the end A pretty awful problem happened in this case to create the possibility of a very strong movie
1	The Night Listener is probably not one of Williams best roles but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie I can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before Some people maybe wont like the slow pacing of this movie but I think its the great plus of the movie It is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year 2006 It has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content dramatic feeling This is no americanized movie Neither is it a predictable movie You just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be This is no excellent movie that has everything but hell its a damn good and very original movie
1	Made by french brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet and narrated by Robert De Niro and Firefighter James Hanlon this is a compelling and heartbreaking tale of how New Yorks finest shone on its darkest day I first saw this when I was a young naive 12 year old and at that age it still touched me Knowing how serious 911 really was seeing this expanded the whole effect of 911 We were finding out who the heroes were how there everyday lives were composed and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people would just run and save their selves These brave men put their lives on the line and watching this just increases my admiration for them Watch if you canthis is the best documentary I have personally ever seen
0	I love the frequently misnomered Masters of Horror series Horror fans live in a constant lack of nourishment Projects like this and the similar Greenlight Project with gave us Feast like it or lump it are breeding grounds for wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of directors with a horror bent to develop and bring to maturation food for we who love to dine on horrorbr br This one began with a kernel of reallykoolidea and ran right off the edge of where in the world am I going with thisbr br I dont know how to spoil the spoiled but SPOILER AHEAD All of a sudden no there was that light drifting across the night sky earlier we have long haired luminescent aliens huh HUH brain drilling males and yeah I get it but well the worst curse of storytelling a rousing and promising set up without a rewarding denouementbr br Cue to storytellers your build up has to have a payoff that exceeds build up Not the other way around Storytelling math 101br br End of Spoilers Big Oops
1	I watched this on an 8 hour flight and presumably because of the pressure and the altitude I actually found it mildly entertaining emphasis on the mildbr br The actual idea behind the film was brilliant a woman dies her fiancé falls in love with someone else she decided to make sure they dont get together but eventually she lets them do it Sadly the actual film wasnt as good OK there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well But from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight I was on I think the whole gaybutnotgay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better The talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest it wasnt really very funnybr br In summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me but it was a close call
1	A horror movie is being shot and things arent going well Its about a masked killer The director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew He goes crazy and kills two people Hes killed himself and the film is never finished Twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish itbut theres a curse People who try and finish it are killed themselves The students ignore that Guess what happens nextbr br The plot is old hat but this isnt badfor what it is a low budget slasher film Its wellmade with a young and fairly talented young cast No one is great but no one is terrible either It also avoids the obligatory and needless female nude scenes It moves quickly the gore is nice and bloody and the script doesnt insult your intelligence Also Molly Ringwald is in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy faded actressbr br No great shakes but not bad at all I give it a 7
0	As much as I dislike saying me too in response to other comments its completely true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following 90br br Having been banned somewhere doesnt make a film watchable Just because it doesnt resemble a Hollywood product does not make it crediblebr br Worse yet in addition to no discernible plot other than there are lots of muddy places in Russia and many people even very old women drink lots of vodka a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating Im in to my second package of Rolaidsbr br As for spoilers well the film is so devoid of any narrative thread I couldnt write one if I triedbr br Dont waste your time or money and dont confuse this with good Russian cinema
1	To my surprise I quite enjoyed Spacecamp i remember seeing it about 13 years ago and recently I hired it again I was quite impressed Obviously the special effects in todays space films such as Armageddon and Deep Impact are far superior to those in SpaceCamp However this film had a story a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it But thats what I liked about it they dont make films like this anymore so it was a refreshing change It was interesting to see Kelly Preston Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in early roles with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw to add substance to the light fluffy plot Absolutely loved the robot named Jinx it was very cute but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters The film was almost inspirational in its own way and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the NASA Spacecamp in Alabama i think
1	I think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943 though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness The film is set in 1940just before the entry of the US into the war Paul Lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family Hes a German who has spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture Bette Davis is his very understanding and longsuffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time As the film begins they are crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years they are going to relax and stop runningbr br The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decentmaking them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems While this had a very noble goal at the time it just seems phony today In particular the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didnt ring true It sounded more like antiFascism speeches than the voices of real children They were as a result extremely annoyingparticularly the littlest one who came off at times as a brat About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them though he had no discernible accentbr br Its really tough to believe that the ultrafamous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog as it just doesnt sound true to life The story was based on the play by his lover Lillian Hellman And the basic story idea and plot is goodbut the dialog is just bad at times Overall an interesting curio and a film with some excellent momentsbut thats really about all
0	Perhaps its because I am so in love with the William Holden Kim Novak version or because Im not a GenXer but this was absolutely the worst remake I have ever seen Without the originals soundtrack it just seemed like another typical TV movieyes about as bland as Kraft cheese
1	After having watched Guinea Pig two questions come in mind besides Am I really a psychopath to watch that Is it a snuff The answer is no although its the closest thing to a snuff movie Ive ever seen And then Where the hell have they found that girl Because she gets tortured for 45 min without any reasons given in fact there is nothing else in this movie Fingernails teared off beaten with hands feet tools infested by maggots and many more until the final scene Im still not sure how they did that Because it belongs to the japonese underground scene its obvious she didnt get a lot of money So what were her their motivations br br I saw it in japonese without subtitles but its not a problem no real dialogues the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes I havent seen yet all the serial but the first Guinea Pig is not known for being the best one Still Ive rated 8 because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff the issue is quite good ask Charlie Sheen the actor But I think they could have gone further which they did in the following onesbr br Another movie Im hiding from my parentsbr br 810
0	En route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway a female reporter runs into a strange hitchhiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination The strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area in the first story an adulterous couple plot to kill the womans husband but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie and in the second story a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed onbr br The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea but with only two stories it falls woefully short And thats not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver the acting is lousy with Joe Haggerty as the taletelling Ebenezer Jackson giving one of the strangest performances I have ever seen the locations are uninspired the script is dreary theres a sex scene with zero nudity and the ending well that beggars beliefbr br To be fair some of Sykes creative camerawork is effective although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused and Joe Castros cheapo gore is enthusiastic an ear is bitten off eyeballs are plucked out a face is removed brains are squished and there is a messy decapitation These positives just about make the film bearable but be warned The Zombie Chronicles aint a stroll in the park even for seasoned viewers of zgrade trashbr br I give The Zombie Chronicles 210 but generously raise my rating to 3 since I didnt get to view the film with the benefit of 3D although I have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldnt have made that much of a difference

0	REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS Ill make this review short and sweet I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman How bad could it be right Well its pretty bad Justin Timberlake plays Pollack a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at Edisons Police Force LL Cool J is Deed a cop within the force on a special force team called FRAT First Response Assault Tactics Hes teamed with an ontheedge bad cop named Lazerov Dylan McDermott In the opening scene we see Lazerov Deed taking on some bank robbers but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs I dont want to give to much away but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs Pollack who works for Ashford Morgan Freeman goes to a trial involving Deeds Lazerov He suspect foul play and with the help of Ashford does some investigate that turns ugly Wallace Kevin Spacey who is all within the FRAT team joins with Ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justicebr br You can tell from the beginning that Freeman and Spaceys performance are pretty lackluster The only person that give a all out performance is Dylan McDermott He is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me LL Cool J is terrible in this film He says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion He was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea Any Given Sunday The film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film The ending is far from satisfyingbr br Dont waste your time with this film Im putting it on Ebay this weekend
1	Anyone new to the incredibly prolific Takashi Miikes work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director In keeping with Miikes working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with What takes the movie out of the realms of the sameold sameold however is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in todays cinema And this isnt that nice cool clean violence so beloved of US cinema this stuff is nasty painful and HURTS That said the pace is breakneck the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities Miikes sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be making it hard to look away from the screen whatever he might be showing you It doesnt have the Ohmigod ending of Dead Or Alive but if youre not squeamish nows the time to get on board the Miike bandwagon before he ends up on some Hollywood studios new John Woo shopping list
0	I am definitely a Burt Reynolds fan but sorry this one really stinks Most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie I cant believe he even made this one Is he actually that hard up for money

0	but Thomas Ian Griffith just doesnt have the polish that a big bucks actor has granted this was made 5 years ago Some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make this not only action but comedy And how do you get KC out of Katia Koslovska anyhow Plummers character was so corny he would have fit better in a Bullwinkle toon Personally if action flicks are going to show skin Id have liked to have seen equal time between femalemale otherwise dont show any
0	A lot of other reviewers here including many whose opinions I respect hold this slice of European sleaze horror in high regard Personally I didnt like it at all Its an incoherent attempt at a atmospheric period cross between sex and violence Jess Franco at his best makes these kinds of films very well Unfortunately the infamous exploitation filmmaker Joe DAmato does not DAmatos most well known films are infamous for their high grossout quotient This an early film by him doesnt have the constant disgusting scenes that his more notorious Anthropophagous and Beyond the Darkness did Ultimately its an incoherent film that doesnt manage to involve the viewer in any way Without the sleaze factor either it becomes very boring As I said others have enjoyed this film but I just found it to be a perfect example of incredibly lazy writingbr br There are a few pluses for the film Ewa Aulin from Candy is in it and she looks pretty hot and is often naked However cult film icon Klaus Kinski is completely wasted in a subplot with no connection to the main film He seems bored with the role and doesnt have the manic intensity he does at his finest The music score is nice and there are some brief moments of unintentionally funny gore Still this is a pretentious and pointless film that manages to be incredibly boring 310
1	A lighthearted comedy Nothing shows us a world that we sometimes wish to escape to a world of nothing Anything you dont like be it a stack of bills a bad memory or even hunger can disappear at your wish They approached this movie very well and with an enjoyable starring duo there were only a few things I didnt like about Nothing and they werent even part of the main moviebr br First the postcredits scene and yes there is one Good for a chuckle but what were they trying to accomplish with that I was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing Instead we just hear a random assortment of noises and they scream It tries to set up a sequel in my opinion and wasnt really necessary nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of framebr br Second the trailer I saw the trailer on the DVD and like others have already said this it promotes a horror movie that never came Oh well poor marketing I guessbr br If you see this at your movie rental store take a look because Nothing is a great movie to watch If you have a big screen though you might want to wear shades
0	The dancing was probably the ONLY watchable thing about this film and even that was disappointing compared to some other films My gawdbr br To me this is the worst kind of film one that assumes its a work of art because it has all the trappings of filmasart Yes its beautifully photographed but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself Tango is a tease its hot it has drama its audacious precisely what this film is not
0	The reason I intended to give this movie a chance to take 2 hours of my life actually it was only 35 minutes was my wish to try to understand and hopefully appreciate Indian cinema All I have ever seen were few older movies of SRaybr br Browsing through IMDb I came across this one and after seeing rating of 87 I concluded this must be the one which will open the doors of unknown and bring artistic enjoyment Oh my how wrong I was The only logical explanation for this rating of 87 is that most of 970 people who voted are Indian and their only venture outside Bolliwood production were Adam Sandler moviesbr br With this rating this movie would be ranked on 9th place on IMDb List of 250 best movies above Citizen Cane Goodfellas of Psycho I am really not in a mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing that I find worth remembering from this painful experience My only hope is that there is a lot of Hindu who like me find this movie as is plain stupid with abundance of kitsch and cheesy music
1	Ive always enjoyed seeing Chuck Norris in film Although the acting may not be superb the fight scenes are fantastic I also enjoyed seeing Judson Mills perform along side him In my opinion the Norris Brothers have proven themselves to be fine entertainers and this was yet another fine production I hope you take the time to view this movie
1	I do try not to take IMDb ratings to heart but I was flabbergasted when I saw the 54 rating to one of my childhood favourites It doesnt wow me as much at 17 but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie Kids will definitely love it and wont mind the flaws and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film None of the film was preachy in any way in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness I will admit though that the story is on the thin side and some scenes like Screweyess deathwhich still freaks me out may be a tad on the scary side But the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation The music by James Horner is very beautiful and the song featured is memorable catchy and amusing I really liked the characters Louie is probably the most indepth of them all but the dinosaurs were at least engaging Martin Shorts clown was both hilarious and emphatic the part when he tells Screweyes I quit had me in stitches My favourite is Screweyes though an effective villain who is crafty and I suppose intelligent If anything though I wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he couldve been more developed in terms of depth The script while not Oscarworthy has its funny and heartwarming parts and should keep kids and adults entertained The voice acting for me was what made the movie John Goodman Martin Short Rhea Perlman Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith all gave solid performances but special mention has to go to Kenneth Mars for he was absolutely superb as Screweyes and almost unrecognisable All in all this is a good movie I dont get the rating honestly I dont Sure this film isnt perfect and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as Land Before Time but it is good fun 7510 Bethany Cox
1	My watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel togetherwhich makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships As a lot has been written about the movie already it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally lovedbr br I think the point where Jesse and Celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending 24 hrs the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt withbr br On the plot front making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplishbr br I believe in romantic flicks of such flavor the characters are not clearly designed even in the writers and directors mind What the actors bring out is what becomes of them right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify to become the character the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the storyhere both the actors do just the RIGHT job Kudosand Before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful
0	Probably encouraged by admirers of her muchbetter Orlando Potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way she writes directs stars and actually cowrites the music including a mawkish love song The film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her But Potters character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango Perhaps if she hadnt cast herself it might have worked She just cant act whether playing herself or not Pretentious overambitious dull and silly
1	I had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago but its concept interested me when I heard it an American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and they spend the night together talking It sparked my interest but I never expected it to be this great Before Sunrise is a masterpiece and its also one of the most romantic films on record To my surprise it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s Its impossible to really talk too much about it since there is no real plot so to speak although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about it is sort of like My Dinner With Andre where there is a conversation but its not JUST the conversation that matters but let me just say see it SEE IT

0	The movie itself is not too bad many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script but it is watchable What really gives me the creeps though is that people like Justin Timberlake even get cast for movies and on top of that for movies like this one I have to admit I had never heard the mans name before watching this but the very instant he appeared I was just plain annoyed The voice is crap the face is a bad ripoff of Legolas the posture is horrible and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them Said to say I was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco because I was hoping from then on it would be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey only Too bad I was wrong These two and also LL Cool J give a very decent performance and they are the main reason I give this a 4 br br I see many upcoming movies with the little Timberlake cast and cannot believe it
1	NOTHING 3 outta 5 stars Another weird premise from the director of the movie Cube This time around there are two main characters who find themselves and their home transported to a mysterious white void There is literally NOTHING outside of their small twostory house Intriguing to be sure but I thought the comedic tone established for this movie from the getgo was extremely illconceived There needs to be some humour certainly and I have no problem with the humour that was eventually derived from the plight of our two heroes their final showdown was definitely a hoot but I really think the movie would have been a lot better off if it had stayed more rooted in reality in the beginning After watching the movie I watched the Making of feature on the DVD and a short trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the sillier comedic aspects making it look like a completely different and slightly better movie The last half hour of the movie is where things really start to come together similar in a way to the recent movie Primer The actors are fine when they are not overdoing the comedy shtick They are really quite believable in their more normal moments I was probably ready to write this movie off as a failed experiment at the midway point but it won me over by the end And keep watching past the credits for the final scene just dont ask me to explain it
1	Lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of Jane Austens satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in provincial 18th Century England Northam and Paltrow are a salutory mixture as friends who must pass through jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other Good humor is a sustaining virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the accessability of the aged source material which has been toned down a bit in its harsh scepticism I liked the look of the film and how shots were set up and I thought it didnt rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the 80s and 90s do Very good results
0	Oh Dear Lord How on Earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone It reeks of cheese from start to finish but its not even good cheese Its the scummiest moldiest most tasteless cheese there is and I cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually truly enjoyed it Yes if you saw it with a load of drunkstoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen I watched it with an upforafewlaughs guy having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the films expected crapness We got the crapness plenty of it but not the chuckles It doesnt even qualify as a sobaditsgood movie Its just plain bad Very very bad Heres why look away if youre spoilerphobic The movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death OK I was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was but I think I grasped the this guy is a bit of a badass who you dont want to mess with message behind the ingenious scene Oh and a guy witnesses it So we already have our ultraevil bad guy and wussy but cute apparently good guy Cue Hero Big Sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish ie Hero is immune to bullets everyone else falls over rather clumsily Cue first plot hole How the bloody hell did Sammy know where this guy was or that hed watched the murder Perhaps this and the answers to all my plothole related questions was explained in the 2 minutes before I got into the cinema but I doubt it In fact Im going to stop poking holes in the plot right here lest I turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese which we all know is good cheese So the plot a very generous word to use Good guy must get to LA evil guy would rather he didnt Hero Sam stands between the two Cue scenery for the next vomitinducing hour the passenger plane As I said no more poking at plot holes Ill just leave it there Passenger plane Next the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie and what makes it everything it is Snakes Yay Oh pause First we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have Hot horny couple see if you can guess how they die deadbeforeanysnakesevenappear British guy those pesky Brits eh cute kids and Jo Brand For all you Americans thats an English comic famous for her size and unattractiveness Now that weve met the cast lets watch all of them die except of course the cute kids Dont expect anything original its just snake bites on various and everincreasingly hilarious really not parts of the body Use your imagination since the filmmakers obviously didnt use theirsbr br So thats most of the film wrapped up so now for the best bit the ending As expected everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face Yep Icecool Sammy included But wait were not all off the plane yet The last guy to get off is good guy but just as he does he gets bitten by a you guessed it snake of all things Clearly this one had been hiding in Mr Jacksons hair the whole time since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier despite the 200ft constrictor the one that ate that pesky British bugger being unable to So Sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop At this point I prayed that the movie was about to make a muchneeded Uturn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort But no In a kind of icing on the cake way but with stale cheese remember it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest How anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me but it did well in summing up the filmbr br Actually were not quite done yet After everyone has sucked face Uncle Sam with leading actress good guy with Tiffany token Black guy with token White girl and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia its time for good guy and hero to get it onIn Bali Nope it wasnt at all exciting the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll Yes the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times Thats it This is the first time Ive ever posted a movie review but I felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography If you like planes snakes Samuel LJackson air hostesses bad guys surfing dogs in bags or English people then please please dont see this movie It will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that youll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again Go see United 93 instead THAT was good
0	I wanted to like Magnolia The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon which I liked 4 different livesstories that come together at the end but Magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and I was lost I almost turned it off right then and there but I felt I should hang in there until the end little did I know it would be another torturous 1 12 hours Thank god I rented instead of seeing it in the theatre I almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours The biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene My DVD player still hasnt forgiven me and I dont blame it one bit It was a unique movie but a bad boring and pointless movie
0	I never was an avid viewer of Crocodile Hunter but did occasionally see an episode or a bit of an episode and when the news spread about Steve Irwins death from a stingray attack in 2006 it certainly caught my attention This movie with Steve and his wife Terri playing themselves but in a fictional story was released in 2002 but I didnt hear of it until several years later and even after that it took me a while to get around to seeing it Well now I have seen it and after looking here first more than once and seeing its rating I was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be though it could have been a BIT better Apparently its supposed to be a comedy so a major problem with it is that it isnt very funny at allbr br A US satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in Australia where it is swallowed by a crocodile While Steve and Terri Irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy Brozzie Drewitt and are unaware of whats inside it two CIA agents are sent to Australia to retrieve the beacon The agents are assisted by Jo Buckley and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them On Steve and Terris mission they face other types of dangerous wildlife not just the crocodile and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it when Steve sees the CIA agents after them he mistakes them for poachers br br Not only did I not laugh once while watching this film the only part that really made me smile was Steve Irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the CIA agents Apart from that I dont think I found anything even mildly amusing Its also a bit of an incoherent mess switching back and forth from the Australian Outback to the CIA headquarters and it seems like clips from Crocodile Hunter and clips from an action thriller or something like that put together for some reason Also added to that mix are the ranch scenes which also seem to be from somewhere else and as funny as Brozzie Drewitt played by Magda Szubanski is supposed to be shes not At one point we see her farting so we have a fart joke a MAJOR cliché in modern comedy Are they SO hard to resist I also found the typical Crocodile Hunter scenes with Steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers to be tedious but I guess the fact that I was never a devout fan of the show didnt helpbr br Steve Irwin was admired by many as a conservationist and is sadly missed by them while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him No matter which side youre on The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course is not a well crafted movie Im sure it does help if youre a big Steve Irwin fan but even if you are theres no guarantee that you would like this movie as some fans clearly havent been impressed In fact it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than I have so maybe it WONT help Like I said theres no guarantee I would say whatever you may think of Steve Irwin and his show this movie was unnecessary The attempt to combine what is usually seen in Crocodile Hunter with a fictional story unfortunately failed and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes

1	When I really began to be interested in movies at the age of eleven I had a big list of must see films and I would go to Blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts I remember one of the films on that list was A Chorus Line and could never get it so now to see it is a dream come truebr br Of course I lost the list and I would do anything to get it back because I think there were some really interesting things to watch there I mean take A Chorus Line a stage play turned into film I know its something we see a lot nowadays but back then it was a little different apparently and this film has something specialbr br Most of the musicals made movies today take the chance the camera gives them for free to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places A Chorus Line was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie Following a big audition held by recognized choreographer Zach Michael Douglas Richard Atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the jobbr br Everything happens on the same day the tension of not knowing the stress of having to learn the numbers the silent competition between the dancers And it all occurs on the stage where Douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences There are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic but they list shortens as the hours go bybr br Like a movie I saw recently A Prairie Home Companion the broadcast of a radio show Atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity On or behind the stage things are going on and time doesnt seem to stop Again I dont if Atenborough cut a lot to shoot this but it sure doesnt look like it and anyway its a great directing and editing John Bloom work But in that little stage what you wonder is what to do with the camera With only one setting Ronnie Taylors cinematography finds the way making closeups to certain characters zooming in and out showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of New Yorkbr br In one crucial moment Douglas tells the ones that are left Before we start eliminating youre all terrific and Id like to hire you all but I cant This made me think about reality shows today where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving even when they are not good Its hard you must imagine at least here where all of them really are terrificbr br To tell some of the stories the characters use songs and in one second the stage takes a new life and it literally is a dream come true The music by Marvin Hamlisch and the lyrics by Edward Kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws showing these dancers feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by Michael Bennett The book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by Arnold Schulman which is very touching at times So if its not with a song it will be with a word but in A Chorus Line its impossible not to be movedbr br During one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition Cassie a special dancer played by Alyson Reed takes the stage to convince Douglas character that she can do it The words let me dance for you never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics

1	Heres an excellent Barbara Stanwyck double bill on one disc The first movie and believe me the lesser of the two is MGMs To Please A Lady 1950 in which she is paired with Clark Gable It is essentially a star vehicle with Gable as usual dominating the film with his screen presence Here he plays a macho racing driver who gets some bad press from feminist reporter Stanwyck and the battle of the sexes begins Of course after much ado they eventually end up in each others arms and it all comes to a predictable and pleasing close A bit of a fluff of a move really but Gable and Stanwyck two icons of the Golden Age make it watchablebr br But the real meat on this DVD is the second feature a marvellous and quite unknown little thriller called JEOPARDY Produced by MGM in 1953 this is a wonderful little gem of a movie that hasnt dated one iota Here Stanwyck plays the wife of Barry Sullivan and mother to their young son Lee Aaker on vacation on a deserted and remote Mexican beach when suddenly tragedy strikes A dilapidated wooden pier collapses trapping Sullivan under a heavy pylon and guess what Yesthe tide is coming in With not a soul in sight and unable to free him herself Stanwyck sets off by car for assistance After driving some distance the only aid she can muster comes from an unscrupulous escaped convict Ralph Meeker who in return for his help wants more from her than money or a change of clothes Ill do anything to save my husband Does she or doesnt she br br Meeker runs away with the picture He turns in quite a brilliant performance Once he comes into the film you simply cannot take your eyes off him An actor in the smouldering Brando style he surprisingly never made much of his career in films Although he gave splendid performances as the unsavoury disgraced cavalry officer in the outstanding MannStewart western Naked Spur 1953 and as one of the doomed sacrificial french troopers in Stanley Kubricks powerful WW1 drama Paths Of Glory 1957 his only real claim to fame was as Mike Hammer in Mickey Spillanes Kiss Me Deadly in 1955 His performance in Jeopardy should have done wonders for him but he had only a soso career in films He died in 1988br br Because of this release Jeopardy can now proudly take its rightful place as a classic noir A memorable taut and exciting thriller thanks to fine performances tight direction by John Sturges the crisp Monochrome Cinematography of Victor Milner and an atmospheric score by Dimitri Tiomkin Extras however are no great shakes except for a radio version of Jeopardy and trailers for both moviesbr br This disc is also part of a Barbara Stanwyck box set celebrating her centenary Hard to believe that the lady would be over 100 years old if she was still aroundbr br JEOPARDY an MGM winner

1	What is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band This disc is NOT for the faint of heartthe music is incredibly intense and VERY cool What you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the Who was so huge for so long It is true that their records were great but their shows were the top of the heap In 1969 when this concert was shot the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the Beatles were gone and bands and audiences had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuositysomething that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by Britney and Christina What you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise Try the concert out it really is amazing
1	A man and his wife get in a horrible car accident When the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live The decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around himbr br This comes to us from director Rob Schmidt who made Wrong Turn a film I have not seen With only one horror film under his belt and not a particularly notorious one at that I was a bit reluctant to watch this episode expecting Schmidt to be a Master of Horror in only the most liberal sense My apologies to him for my underestimation As of episode 10 in a 13 episode season this was actually the best one yetbr br The issue of the right to die is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device However this is only the foundation on which the story revolves Once the horror elements show up the film goes from decent to spectacular Great acting great plot great dialogue great suspense I was a little creeped out at times which is good and most of all the gore is in extreme abundance I read a review of this episode prior to watching it where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of Hellraiser in this Through the first part of the show I had no idea what they were talking about Then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of Hellraiser 2 However I in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film I can see no other way to create the effect that was created and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than Hellraiser 2br br Some plot twists show up later on and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look I didnt watch it a second time but I think the beginning would make more sense if I had not that its confusing The subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice and I found myself going back and forth about whether I disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if I felt bad for him Hes somewhat of an antihero to the whole story if you will I feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist but hes completely unlovablebr br While the Stuart Gordon episode may be better and Im excited about the Washingtonians episode I think I could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine When legends like John Carpenter let me down again I get a bit worried about the genres future but then a fresh face like Rob Schmidt comes along and gives me hope This one is a keeper and please bring Schmidt back for season 3
1	Watching this movie again really brought back some great childhood memories Im 34 now have not seen it since I was 1214 I had almost forgotten about this movie but when I watched it again recently some scenes literally brought a tear to my eye That little robot Jinxfriends for ever It was just like revisiting my childhood It was an absolutely amazing experience for me I will always cherish this movie for that reason I hope some of you readers can relate to my experience not for this particular movie but any movie you have not seen in a long while Very nostalgicbr br Thanks for reading
1	Titanic has to be one of my alltime favorite movies It has its problems what movies dont but still its enjoyablebr br When I stumble across someone who asks me why I like Titanic I suppose my first reaction is wait a minute you dont I know so many people who dont like this movie and Im not saying I dont see why The love story is too cheesy well yes but isnt it enjoyable and moving All right the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic everyone knows that love like this doesnt actually exist But this is a movie doesnt everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while The next complaint DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors Well OK in this movie I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials However I think its unfair to say that they are terrible actors I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in But the roles they are given are simple and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expectedbr br And finally if one is going to complain that they dont like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic movies then Im sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things Its like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies Simply for being a movie not because you dislike the genre this IS a good moviebr br Well deserving of its Oscars in particular Best Cinematography which I find to be the best Ive ever seen in a movie save maybe the Lord of the Rings trilogybr br I know some of the writing fails such as the constant screaming of each others names throughout the movie The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times but overall its an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real and the sinking feel so epicbr br I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea such as it being a love story rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructedbr br I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic including memoirs form the day it happened and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults The only main ones I can find is that the piping should be threaded copper not steel and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit itbr br I give this movie 1010 not because I like romance movies but simply because its an outstanding cinematic achievement that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events
0	This film is one giant pant load Paul Schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay And his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process br br The worst though is Woody Harrelson whom I ordinarily like when hes properly cast He plays the walker a homosexual man in DC who plays social companion to the bored wives of the Washington elite He couldnt have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick His southern accent is that off the rack version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers as though the heat and humidity of the South is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has It is monotonous But his is not the worst accent in the movie His boyfriend played by Moritz Bleibtreau attempts to affect some kind of a Mid East accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him He is incapable of rolling his rs in spite of the fact that in real life he is German and speaks several languages one of them being Italian Thats kind of a good reason to cast someone else dont ya think br br From the story to the screenplay to the directing to the camera work to the performances by the leads this movie is bad from beginning to end The only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses Lily Tomlin Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas Only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact In fact all three are excellent in spite of being trapped in a really bad film Ufortunately no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws If you like these three actresses watch them in something else This movie is not worth your time
0	Based upon the recommendation of a friend my wife and I invited another couple to this film I really apologized to themall 4 of us hated it and spent the whole time looking at our watches waiting for the film to finally end Half the vignettes are bizarre with very little entertainment value There were few scenes of Parisfor example I was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the Latin Quarter but I couldnt really recognize anything Most of the scene was inside a bar No one in the theater laughed at anything or reacted in any way If you like bizarre pretentious pseudointellectual films dont miss this If you are down to earth like me you will be sorry you saw it
0	Some of the filmmakers who are participating in this series have made some really great films but they sure as heck are not showing much skill with this series Particularly the writing OK the first season was somewhat better but these new episodes they are creating just stink Im a huge fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage Nothing new or genuinely interesting Few of them are visually creative Its just typical fabricated Hollywood crap uninteresting childish poorly conceived and in some cases flat out laughable Much like Tales from the Crypt the only good thing this series has been offering is great nudity Other then that this series blows hard I get the impression sometimes that they hired a bunch of eighthgraders to write the episodes Maybe they did
1	Im grateful to Cesar Montano and his crew in reviving the oncemoribund Visayan film understorey Panaghoy is hopefully the forerunner of a resurgence in this vernacular that claims more speakers than Tagalog The dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the Philippines Downside the corny and stilted acting of the American antagonist The other item that I didnt appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the period costume of the same character and above all his bright red kitcar that I suppose was meant to pass for a 1930s roadster Without those small yet glaring details Panaghoy wouldve been at least a 9 out of 10 on my ratingdaghang salamat Manoy Cesar Addendum this film sure beats Peque Gallagas Oro Plata Mata which provided a different view of the Visayas during the Second World War Alos there are some parts where the cinematography harks back to Spielbergs The Color Purple and the storyline begins to become reminiscent of Noli Me Tangere

0	Forest of the Damned starts out as five young friends brother sister Emilio Richard Cambridge Ally Sophie Holland along with Judd Daniel Maclagan Molly Nicole Petty Andrew David Hood set off on a week long holiday in the middle of nowhere their words not mine Anyway before they know it theyre deep in a forest Emilio clumsily runs over a woman Frances Da Costa along with a badly injured person to add to their problems the van theyre travelling in wont start they cant get any signals on their mobile phones They need to find help quickly so Molly Judd wander off in the hope of finding a house as time goes by darkness begins to fall it becomes clear that they are not alone that there is something nasty lurking in the woodsbr br This English production was written directed by Johannes Roberts having looked over several other comments reviews both here on the IMDb across the internet Forest of the Damned seems to divide opinion with some liking it others not personally it didnt do much for at all The script is credited on screen to Roberts but here on the IMDb it lists Joseph London with additional screenplay material whatever that means the film is your basic backwoods slasher type thing like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974 with your basic stranded faceless teenage victims being bumped off but uses the interesting concept of fallen angels who roam the forest kill people for reason that are never explained to any great deal of satisfaction Then theres Stephen played by the ever fantastic Tom Savini who is never given any sort of justification for what he does Is he there to get victims for the angels If so why did he kill Andrew by bashing his head in The story is very loose it never felt like a proper film The characters are poor the dialogue not much better the lack of any significant story makes it hard to get into it or care about anything thats going on Having said that it moves along at a reasonable pace there are a couple of decent scenes herebr br Director Johannes doesnt do anything special its not a particularly stylish or flash film to look at Theres a few decent horror scenes the Tom Savini character is great whenever hes on screen although why didnt he hear Judd breaking the door down with an axe while escaping with Molly its a shame when he gets killed off There are a couple of decent gore scenes here someone has their head bashed in theres a decapitation someone gets shotgun blasted someone throat is bitten out someones lips are bitten off someone is ripped in half There is also a fair amount of full frontal female nudity not that it helps muchbr br Technically Forest of the Damned is OK its reasonably well made but nothing overly special or eyecatching This was shot in England Wales its quite odd to see an English setting for a very American themed backwards horror The acting is generally pretty poor save for Savini who deserves to be in better than this Horror author Shaun Hutson has an embarrassing cameo at the end proves he should stick to writing rather than actingbr br Forest of the Damned was a pretty poor horror film it seems to have fans out there so maybe Im missing something but its not a film I have much fondness for Apart from one or two decent moments theres not much here to recommend

0	This movie was made for fans of Dani and Cradle of Filth I am not one of them I think hes just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon still Im generally not a fan of black metal But as I was carrying this DVD case to pay for it I convinced myself that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing Thus I assumed Im in for a rollercoaster ride of rubber gore and doityourself splatter with a sinister background Now that is what I do likebr br I got home and popped it in My patience lasted 15 minutes AWFUL camera work and DISGUSTING quality And that was then 2002 that it looked like it was shot using a Hi8 camcorder I left it on the shelf Maybe a nice evening with beer and Bmovies would create a nice setting for this picture br br After a couple of months I got back to it in mentioned surroundings and saw half Then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me My disliking evolved I noticed how funny Dani 165m 55 height looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart Yes ripping His head apparently had no skull I also found that this movie may have no sense Still I havent finished it yet so I wasnt positivebr br After a couple more tries I finally managed to finish this flick a couple of months back Yes it took me 55 years So Dani in fact was funny as SatanMansonsuperevilmans HELPER and the movie DID NOT make sense See our bad person employs Dani to do bad things He delivers Why Well I guess hes just very very bad As a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much itbr br We have a couple of short stories joined by Danis character My favourite was about a guy who STEALS SOMEONES LEG because he wants to use it as his own Yeah exactly br br The actings ROCK BOTTOM The CGI is the worst ever I mean Stinger beats it and boy is Stingers CGI baaaaad The story has no sense And the quality is Lets just say it is not satisfying The only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore Blood and guts are made pretty well Why you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on Example Dani The Man Filth takes a stuffed cat fake as can be and guts it and then eats what fell out Why We never know We do know however that this cat must have been on illegal substances as his heart is almost half his sizebr br You might think after my comment that this movie is so bad its good but its just bad Cradle of Filth fans can add 3 points I added one for gore
0	Ok I have read about this film somewhere in the internet and many criticized on how bad and sucks this film was And I couldnt have been more agree about it Then after that I saw this film on DVD I was thinking twice about this and then came commercial of this film on TV Luckily I spared my money for this pieces of crap I was sacrificed my sleeps for this film and soon it turned out that this film couldnt make me satisfy So I cant be judging on how the film was made but anyway it still sucks As for those who liked this film I would apologize for flaming this film and telling on how sucks this film is I dont know what do YOU think about this film
1	YesIm going with the 10 on this and heres why In the last few years I have watched quite a few comedies and only left with a few mild laughs and a couple video rental late fees because the movies were that easy to forget Then I stumble upon Nothing Looked interesting wasnt expecting much though I was wrong This was probably one of the funniest movies I have ever had the chance to watch Dave and Andrew make a great comedic pair and the humor was catchy enough to remember but not over complex to the point of missing the joke I dont want to remark on any of the actual scenes because I do feel this is a movie worth seeing for once With more and more pointless concepts coming into movies you know like killer military jets and fresh remakes that are ruining old classics This movie will make you happy to say its OK to laugh at Nothing
0	This film had so much promise I was very excited about this film In the end it was laughable at best painful at worst The acting styles ran the gamut from really really flat the angels the wife and daughter to overanimated Caspers character I felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other Pay special attention to the scene regarding the bug Its pretty much an insult to the audiences ability to figure things out In defense of that scene though it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie I had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations Too bad they didnt make use of it I didnt feel like I was transported to exotic locations Anybody could insert stock footage of the Coliseum in Rome However to end on a positive note I thought the sets were pretty good I really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers It is my opinionand thats all it is that if the SCHMALTZ factor would have been much much lower and the ACTION factor would have been greatly increased this film would have been good
1	I wait for each new episode each rerun with anticipation The new look of scifi created by Stargate SG1 is a wonder that I hope will never end To combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me Season 9 should be a thrill in itself I wish that Richard Dean Anderson would show up more often in the new season as I love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as Jack ONeill The other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner season after season You cancel this program in the next three years and you make a serious mistake Also you need a bigger role for the Asgard they are just too cool
0	WriterDirector Bart Sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by NASA He says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks The astronauts were in low Earth orbit all the time and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished filmbr br Unfortunately Sibrels research is so slipshod that he doesnt realize his backstage footage is really taken in large part from the 30minute live telecast also on that reel that was seen by millions not hidden away in NASA vaults as he implies And we have to wonder why Sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts audio in the footage because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera not faking footagebr br Finally anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy Sibrels hackedup version of it He shows you more of the Zapruder film of JFKs assassination than of his smoking gun Sibrel thinks hes the only one whos seen it Whats more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that Sibrel chose NOT to use such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant Earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway Earthbr br As with most films of this type Sibrel relies on innuendo inexpert assumption misleading commentary and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence
1	I must admit that at the beginning I was sort of reticent about watching this movie I thought it was this stupid little romantic film about a French woman who meets in the train an American and decides to visit Vienna with him I was not actually enchanted about this kind of script since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie Still I watched it And I was amazedBefore Sunrise is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth we are sentenced to death or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity or that we humans can afford sometimes to live in fairytales br br The ending was wonderfully chosen we do not know if they will meet again in six months at six oclock in Viennas station in our optimism we sincerely hope so The actors acted in a very good manner so that I began to believe that I myself could live a lovestory just like this
1	This would have worked a lot better if it had been made as Mitchell in Malta At least then we would have been spared the sight of Joe Don Baker running around an otherwise scenic Mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfitnot to mention acting like an Old West gunslinger Mitchell being Mitchell the film wouldnt have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either Oh well At least the comic comments of Mike and the Bots made this enjoyable fare as an episode of MST I cant imagine watching it on its own however
1	This is a really old fashion charming movie The locations are great and the situation is one of those old time Preston sturgess movies Fi you want to watch a movie that doesnt demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it The acting is good and I really liked Michael Rispoli He was in Rounders too And While You Were Sleeping The rest of the cast is fun Its just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own weddings I know sounds kooky but it is And thats what makes it fun to watch It will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you but at least youll know
1	While the British produced some hilarious and slick sitcoms in the 1990s Ab Fab Men Behaving Badly One Foot in the Grave etc the 70s were the real golden agebr br In the 1970s there were whole new territories to explore including the sexual revolution feminism and the slowly evolving awareness of a need for sensitivity that would twenty years later become Political Correctness Attempts to grapple with the confusion of this thoroughly modern world were the subtle and notsosubtle themes in everything from the skits of Monty Pythons Flying Circus to sitcoms like Man About the House By the late 70s this grappling resulted in more meditative and bittersweet sitcoms such as the masterpiece Butterfliesbr br Man About the House is a perfect example of the good Britcoms of the time slightly genteel cheeky fresh ingenuous sometimes outrageous with some well made observations on contemporary life Compare it to a cynical 90s show such as Ab Fab and it is hard to believe the two were created in the same countrybr br Man About the House is one of the great Britcoms of the 70s right up there with Good Neighbors The Good Life and About the Houses spin off George and Mildred Its quality is attested to by the fact that as with Good Neighbors its creators writers and many of its cast have had continued success in British television
0	It has a great name but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money in fact the first 3040mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just cant understand whats happening until the action its gonebr br And yet the producers Roberto Angel Salcedo calls him an actor but i dont think the way he does could be called nothing but overactingperiod The little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doingbr br For some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it but they didnt and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad i dont buy itbr br But hopefully this is as bad as it gets To make people accept those DVDs to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it that might work outbr br Maka

0	There was not one original idea in this story Themes were pulled from various sources a few being The Ninth Gate In the Mouth of Madness another Carpenter film and The Ring It even went as far as featuring the same damn glowing circle from The Ring and using it as the films namesake The soundtrack by Cody Carpenter was all but lifted from Suspiria Hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word HOMAGE around Yes I saw that the theater was playing Argentos Deep Red Claiming an homage would be a bullshit copout This was bottomofthebarrel Throwing gore and disturbing imagery into the pot does not make a good horror film Carpenter used to know that He should fade into obscurity or acquire a time machine

0	Im sorry to say this but the acting in this film is horrible The dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever Perhaps I got the dress rehearsal version by mistake The director overuses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves The story is pretty well written and the fight sequences are actually better than I have seen in many action films The fights seem pretty real But all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of pointblank automatic weapon fire grenades morter rounds and bazookas The enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots I have ever seen especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about 30 yards and every bazooka shot is wide by at least 50 feet Those bazookas need serious site calibration
0	First of all what is good in the movie Some pretty actress the exotic background the fact that the actors dont laugh while acting I would have if I had been in their situation I dont know The storyline is simple a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who another abstract painter killed his little brother a male prostitute raped by another priest when he was young Im afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers art or religion Dennis Hopper is not very good here This is the worst episode of the worst season of profiler the serie with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences the uncle is the policeman who the girl who lives at another victims house could have a baby with the priest etc etc

1	Although Super Mario 64 isnt like the rest of the games in the series it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games Games with this much replay value are few and far between Plus this game has so much variety There are 15 levels each with several different tasks you can do and many other hidden tasks The game isnt very challenging but its lack of challenge doesnt take away from the game at all Once you beat it youll want to erase your game and start again And its just as much fun the second time or third time or two hundredth time A must own for any Nintendo 64 owner and is a reason in itself to own a Nintendo 64
0	People please dont bother to watch this movie This movie is bad Its totally waste of time I dont see any point here Its a Stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor I rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again
1	This movie is a little unusual in that its got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace While this makes it pretty different from the average Grant film it is still highly watchable and entertaining Its sort of like someone said lets just follow Cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed Considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas the film works very well While the film has pretty modest pretensions it makes the most of the material Its a great film for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family

0	Spoilers containedbr br Id heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific What I didnt expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go What starts off as a typical cowboyindian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic comedy about Honus Soldier Blue of the title played by Peter Strauss and Cresta Candice Bergen who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the Cheyenne The majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit Donald Pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason They then escape and both turn up separately at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the Cheyenne base As Cresta used to be married to one of the Cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them So far so ordinary Then comes the ending After enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will theywont they get together storyline the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head Similarities can be drawn with the Wild Bunch at this point of the film but the Wild Bunch kept the same tone throughout and didnt resort to extreme gratuitous violence In some ways Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perrys Last Summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending I didnt hate Soldier Blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending If you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents I would recommend Elem Klimovs Come and See
1	An American woman her European husband and children return to her mothers home in Watch on the Rhine a 1943 film based on the play by Lillian Hellman and starring Paul Lukas whom I believe is repeating his stage role here Bette Davis Lucile Watson George Coulouris Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Woods An antiFascist a worker in the underground movement many times injured and wanted by the Nazis Kurt Muller Lukas is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy motherinlaw But he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests Coulouris is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him outbr br Great performances abound in this film written very much to put forth Lillian Hellmans liberal point of view It was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe American homes The movies big controversy today is that Paul Lukas won an Oscar over Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous Rick but Lukas is transcendent as Kurt The monologue he has about the need to kill is gutwrenching just to mention one scenebr br Though this isnt what one thinks of as a Bette Davis movie she gives a masterful performance here as Kurts loyal and loving wife Sara Her acting tugs at the heart and the love scenes between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and tenderbr br The last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions Lillian Hellman is not everyones cup of tea but unlike The Little Foxes she has written some truly sympathetic wonderful characters and a fine story given A casting and production values by Warner Brothers Highly recommended
1	This is very nearly a perfect film The ideas would be repeated by Mamet but never told so succinctly This is really about the failure of trust of the human condition The film weaves the idea that we are all criminals no one is innocent Is there anyone alive today who hasnt seen this play out in our own society every single day The film is very much structured like a Hitchcock thriller Except there are no more innocent characters The world is now completely polluted ruined and everyone is participating in the con Could anything be more truebr br Dont miss the soundtrack It is wonderful
1	When I was little my parents got this movie for me to watch I really liked it and I watched it over and over again Even when I was in 3rd grade I still watched it from time to time Recently I watched it again just for the sake of nostalgia and though the show was not aimed for my age group Im in my late teens I still found it entertaining and educational This show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along well with others Some parts I found quite entertaining Also this show does not have any bad content so you can leave kids alone with this show and not worry about them picking up any bad language or whatnot I would recommend this
0	In an otherwise good review loleralacartelort7890 says The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminumantiradiationalloy It is not that wellknown And the exact specifications are a secret And why is it a secret Well why should they reveal it back then If they where in a space race with the Russians then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation This is completely incorrect There is and was no secret to radiation protection in Apollo The design and construction of the Apollo Command Module has long been publicly available It uses a lightweight honeycomb of aluminum and stainless steel The entire outer surface except the windows of course is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin thicker on the bottom that faces forward during reentry These materials are actually better at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space charged particles than lead which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like Xrays and gamma raysbr br Space radiation is a definite problem for long term space flight because of the risk of big solar flares But it simply wasnt a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts The Command Module gave them pretty good protection during their brief 12 hour or so passage through the Van Allen belts They all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received no more than 15 rem and usually much less Of the 24 men who flew to the Moon 12 of whom landed 18 are still alive Only two have died from cancer Alan Shepard leukemia and Jack Swigert bone cancer The rest died from heart attacks pancreatitis Roosa and a motorcycle accident Conrad These are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late 70s Shepard would be 86
1	Maybe its just because I have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff but this one got under my skin pardon the pun This piece is brave not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies Not only did I find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy towards the screwee I felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself Some parts are very reminiscant of Hellraiser but come off as tribute rather than imitation Its a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider but I enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile This piece brings it and doesnt appologize I liked this one a lot Do NOT watch whilst eating pudding
1	Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby Azaria Chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense Based on the book Evil Angels and titled so in its Australian release A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch It presents a scenario thats all too real for us in America the witchhunt against a person deemed an easy targetbr br Lindy Chamberlain was this woman Being someone who spoke her mind someone who didnt play the sympathy card and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didnt kill her own child The media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece And through it all Lindy remained as stoic as ever even when her husband Michael was falling apartbr br This stance of course is the power of strength as unsympathetic as it may look like and people happen to react strongly to that They want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn not sit there and look blank People dont understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold but not unfeeling woman one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty Because of her Sam Neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair someone has to or the Chamberlains would be too detached and no one wants to see that Except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the newsmedia Theyll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public
0	I think the show had a pretty good concept to work with But the execution was poor The script is poor and acting is bad There were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard The show cant be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably I should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of Muslim community to some extentbr br Till now second season is worse than the first one I had my hopes high regarding this show but I was kind of disappointed Still I appreciate CBC for putting up such concept in front of the viewers Anyway I wish best of luck for the future
0	As a Jane Eyre fan I was excited when this movie came out At last I thought someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author Wrong If the casting director was intending to cast a Jane who was plain he certainly succeeded However surely he could have found one who could also act Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester Where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere Where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother Finally why was the plot changed at the end One wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book What a disappointment
0	Quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathombr br A group of top quality actors in the main well cast with a couple of notable exceptions who give pretty good performances Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and equally good is Joanna Lumley as Diana All do well with the scripts they were givenbr br So much for the good The average would include the sets Nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book although bizarrely the house they use for the Dower House looks remarkably like it It is clear then that the Dower House is far too big In the later parts the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the UK presumably to save money although with a little imagination I have no doubt they could have recreated Ceylonbr br Now to the bad The screenplay This is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it Edward does not die in the battle of Britain but survives blinded He makes a brief appearance then commits suicide why Loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with Gus to a sensible farmers wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear less emotional than Brief Encounter Gus a man besotted and passionately in love is prepared to give up his love without complaint Walter Mudge in the book turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man Jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who wont speak Aunt Biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification The Dower House is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with Jess who has a fear of armed soldiers Whilst Miss Mortimers breasts are utterly delightful I could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward The delightfully named Nettlebed becomes the mundane Dobson The word limit prevents me from continuing the listbr br There is a sequel which I lost all interest in watching after this nonsense and I wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story It is difficult to image that Rosamunde Pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased
0	Ive seen the Gator Bait films and this is almost exactly the same thing as those A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them The thing that sets this movie apart from those ones although not very far is that the sexual content is not glorified There is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film but not for a second is it ever sexy Some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive but thats only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audiences need to see this woman seek revengebr br This is a weak film it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers I Spit On Your Grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral but I was glad to see that since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead it was not meant to pass off as a TA filmbr br Bmovies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality and while I Spit On You Grave is unmistakably a Bmovie and contains more than its share of nudity the nudity does not drive the plot On the other hand the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists These men are evolutionary dropouts just like they were in the Gator Bait films and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless Bmovie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind but instead it simply satisfies the audiences desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve br br The one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks Oddly the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity although not by much but it is by far the most painful to watch We are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord but again this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us withbr br spoilers You know that this is all the movie means to do since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed The woman does not live happily ever after she doesnt write her book she doesnt leave and never return to that nightmare place she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks But hey what more did you expectbr br Oh and did you read the tagline If you decide to waste your time watching this try and find any man getting broken or burned I was really looking forward to those
1	This is a most handsome film The color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the Metropolitan Opera House in brilliant color Other indoor scenes at various mansions etc are equally brilliant As for the music what more can be said other than that Lanzas voice was at its peak as he sang so many of the worlds best known and beloved arias The marvelous Dorothy Kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of Lanza in delightful harmony Of course Hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of Caruso There is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events For example the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth There are some very good web sites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain several pictures of him These web sites can be located by using any good search engine There are also several books available concerning his life history But the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film The voices of Lanza Kirsten and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie Enjoy I know that I sure did
0	The first half was OK but the last half really really disappointed Its funny the producers even admitted they didnt have a clue for the ending and it really showed Whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this I really didnt want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isnt really worth that effort When Battlestar galatica first came out I was really excited with the prospect of a better remake it didnt happen that first season border on being space porn They eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama so I started watching again But to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel same with baltar and six was pretty dumb
1	Its a very good movie not only for the fans of Lady Death comics but also for those who like animated moviesseries of adventure and fantasybr br The film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadnt done but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell Lucifer himselfbr br Then she seeks revengeand the rest you better see it from the moviebr br I liked the movie a lot the characters are like the original comics form Chaos I never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics only the last ones after the passages in the movie so I cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics butone way or another its the story of Lady Death
0	there is no suspense in this serial When one episode ends the acting is so shoddy the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how Batman and Robin will save the day No in fact the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode This show is so boring that I cant see how it ever got made let alone released on DVD Obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary Batman films but even the script is awful An incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that I am not quite sure because it is too awful to follow Watch the 60s version or the 90s versions or even Batman Begins just anything over this version
0	While I have never been a fan of the original ScoobyDoo due to its horrid production values it appears like Shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by HannaBarbera Without a doubt ScrappyDoo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children and this includes the Teletubbies as well as Tommy the Tapeworm Whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the ScoobyDoo characters with it Whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show I think death is preferable The bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny annoying and grates on the nervesand this is only in the BETTER episodes After many years it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess I can see why in the liveaction ScoobyDoo movie they made the villain ScrappyDoosince practically everyone hates him

0	I agree with one of the other comment writers about good story good actors but mismatched and I would also say rushed It has been about 24years since I read the book as it was in school But I felt that you would need to know the story of Jane Eyre when watching this one as bits are left out therefore it doesnt fully make sense For example Jane Mr Rochester have hardly spoken suddenly he is proposing marriage The actors dont have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the storyThe actors are good but arent given enough time to do this story justice Im sorry to say it but I didnt really enjoy this versionThe 1970 version with Susanna York George C Scott would be the Jane Eyre movie of my preference BUT you should check out the 1983 BBC mini series version with Zelah Clarke Timothy Dalton in the 2 main roles I love it so much I watch it regularlyThere is an abridged version which goes for 225mins or the full version for 330mins
1	Fairly funny Jim Carrey vehicle that has him as a News reporter who temporarily gets the power of God and wrecks havoc Carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time and Jennifer Aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting The story is predictible to the extreme but the cast including Morgan Freeman as God is great and makes the film worth catching GRADE B
0	Granting the budget and time constraints of serial production BATMAN AND ROBIN nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any cliffhanger list utterly lacking the style imagination and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor BATMANbr br The producer Sam Katzman was known as King of the Quickies and like his director Spencer Bennett seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement Unfortunately this team also produced the two Superman serials starring Kirk Alyn with their tacky flying animation canned music and dull supporting players The opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come thoroughly inane titles Robin Rescues Batman Batman vs Wizard mechanical music droning on and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap Halloween masks Batmans cowl with its devils horns and eagles beak fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes His utility belt is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical momentsbr br In any case the lead players are miscast Robert Lowery displays little charm or individual flair as Bruce Wayne and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as Batman He creates the impression that hed rather be somewhere anywhere else John Duncan as Robin has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue He is too old for the part with an even older stuntman filling in for him Out of costume Lowery and Duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink without one ounce of the chemistry evident between Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft in the 1943 serialbr br Although serials were not known for character development the earlier BATMAN managed to present a more energetic cast This one offers a group going through the motions not that the filmmakers provide much support Not one of the hoodlums stands out and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever The Wizard Great name Actually they are led by someone sporting a curtain a shawl and a sack over his head with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing The prime suspects an eccentric professor a radio broadcaster are simply annoyingbr br Even the established comic book regulars are superfluous It is hard to discern much romance between Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne Despite the perils she faces Vicki displays virtually no emotion Commissioner Gordon is nonetoobright Unlike in the previous serial Alfred the butler is a mere walkon whose most important line is Mr Waynes residence They are props for a drawnout gimmickladen incoherent plot further saddled with uninspired repetitive music and amateurish production design The Wayne Manor exterior resembles a suburban middleclass home in any sitcom the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel The Batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing The costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinetbr br Pity that the filmmakers couldnt invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure While the availability of the two serials on DVD is a plus for any serious Batfan one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box They capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of BATMAN AND ROBIN combinedbr br Now for the good news this is not the 1997 version
0	This ABC straighttoTV failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is A Wrinkle in Time Ms Madeleine LEngle brought children and adults alike into a magical fantastical and original world like no author before her This novel the first in her time quartet is a beautiful take on life the universe and time itself Yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand Its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book This film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of Ms LEngles work of art Honestly what were they thinking The effects look cheap and ridiculous the plot is mushy and uneven the dialogue is farfetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost This was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen I sincerely hope that someday an intelligent worthy director Guillermo del Toro David Yates Alfonso Cuarón makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is a masterpiece This adaptation can only be compared to boring fake and cheap motelroom art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience

0	According to IMDb Takashi Miikes Master of Horrorsegment Imprint was banned in the US So I figured Id translate the Swedish review I just wrote for itbr br It was hard to NOT have any sort of expectations from Ichi The Killerdirector Takashi Miikes episode in the Masters of Horror series And the DVDcover of Imprint did in deed look very promisingbr br The story mostly takes place in a remote Japanese bordello some time during the 19th century and it tells the tale of a journalist searching for Komomo the woman he left behind and whom he promised to return for Tired and dejected he arrives at the bordello hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey It turns out that one of the prostitutes a deformed and quiet girl know about Komomo and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what has happened to her since he left The story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallowbr br The first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the Japanese cast for the most part spoke fluent AmericanEnglish But I will leave it at that its not that big a deal What IS a big deal however is how miserable the rest of it was Miikes tale moves at such a slow pace that I couldnt help looking at my watch several times during the 63 minutes The extended torurescene that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie felt so unmotivated and pornographically intrusive that not even THAT scene became interesting I felt like it was violent just for the sake of violence itself with no sense of style or purpose The only scenes that provoked any kind of emotion out of me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the swiftly flowing waterand in all honesty the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgustbr br The journalist seeking the love he left behind is played by Billy Drago for me most memorable as Frank Nitti Al Capones whiteclad assassin in Brian De Palmas The Untouchables 1987 Ive always found Dragos portrayal of Nitti to be very icy and I mean that in a good way and that is probably why I was almost annoyed when I found him to be so terrible NOT in a good way in this one His acting seems to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever to displays of some really bad overacting When his character is supposed to react to the awful things Komomo has been subjected to I was sitting in the sofa twisting and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible actingjob put forth by Drago Im grateful that most of the story is told by Yuoki Kudoh Memoirs of a geisha 2005 who plays the deformed prostitutebr br The finale is probably supposed to be chocking maybe even revolting and horrid but I just found it to be kind ofyou know blah and I looked at my watch again for the umptieth time just wishing the crappy episode would end Maybe the finale caused me to smile just a bit but thats only because I couldnt help thinking of an episode of Red Dwarf and the upsidedown chins of Craig Charles and Danny JohnJules with eyes glued on them to make them look like aliens Lucky you if youve seen that episode and now decide to see Imprint I will forever have ruined the visuals of the ending for youbr br My first thought when Imprint finally ended was that the only thing that made the pain of watching it worth it was hearing the main title theme by Edward Shearmur the same music I believe is used in every episode of this series and that if anything is a big friggin warning dont you thinkbr br One might point to the costume design by Michiko Kitamura and say that there at least is something NOT lacking in style and refinementbut there are so many other films and TVshows that is so much better at showing off the Japanese geishafashion This is nothing but inferior and I am disappointed Takashi Miikes Masters of Horrorepisode is boring uninspiring and pointless In other words Its really really BAD
1	House of Games is spell binding Its so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens There are few movies Ive seen that can grip you so quickly From the opening scene this movie just gets youbr br Im trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a FEW SPOILERS SO DONT READ ANYMORE IF YOU DONT WANT TO KNOWbr br I would say House of Games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists I have ever seenbar none From the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayedbr br Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is simply perfection from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately Joe Mantegna was also wonderful The dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices I also loved the way the movie was filmed in that grainy surreal type of way it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it wasbr br There were a few movies Ive seen and loved that this reminded me of including The Grifters and The usual Suspects but really House of games is completely different in its way Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbing characters Ive seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying You know somethings going to happen but you have no idea what And just when you think youve guessed what the something is you realize you havent even scratched the surfacebr br House of Games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature The character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well As the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it It is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to its conclusionbr br In closing Id rank this 10 of 10 call it although not my absolute favorite film pretty high on the list most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best twists Ive ever seen as well Although I love all types and genres of movies when it comes to movies of the human psyche it really doesnt get much better then this See this movie
0	It a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of Oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an Asian background does NOT EVEN SHOW ONE ASIAN OR AFRICAN person not even as an extra That fact probably describes Norwegian race relations in general Howeverbr br NO SPOILERS ONLY A BRIEF INTRODUCTORY DESCRIPTIONbr br Buddy portrays four young people living in a flatshare in Oslo The protagonist are two young men that dont manage to direct their life in any serious fashion and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility a sort of fear of growing up The narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models Quite the cliché Although the story is mildly funny the acting is good and as a young person one can sort of identify with the characters crazy situations and complicated love affairs I dont find the story or the characters very believable To polished and lacking in depth This film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as Friends yes that show on TVbr br Has Norwegian film finally found its identity Audience pleasers in well known American stylebr br How about watching Lukas Moodyssons Tillsammans Together
1	Okay I know this doesnt project India in a good light But the overall theme of the movie is not India its Shakti The power of a warlord and the power of a mother The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth Then things go terribly wrong The interaction between Nandini and her father in law the power of their dysfunctional relationship and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie Shah Rukh Khans performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of Karisma Kapoor It is easy to get caught up in the love violence and redemption of lives in this film and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax The musical interludes are strengths believable and well done
1	I grew up with this as my alltime favorite film The special effects are incredible for the era and won awards I can remember the dialogue as if Id heard it yesterday It is simply a great timeless adventure The music is by Miklos Rosza who is cinema historys best Sabu is the Thief Conrad Veidt is the grand villain I have a copy within reach for the next trip down memory lane Whoa there Rex Ingram wants out of his genii bottle

1	This is a good example a film that in spite of the low rating is more than worth watching The story is engaging and it doesnt take long before the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin grabs your attention The acting is first class and the characters are represented well Sometimes it feels like the director couldnt decide himself between drama and romantic comedy Ben Chillers portrayal of the law abiding and shy Englishman with porn SM magazines hidden in the bedroom creates plenty of moments for laughs As does the look in Nicole Kidmans eyes when she is offering John his first taste of intimacy in a long time Other times the actors and especially Nicole Kidman give this comedy quite expertly a dramatic slant

1	There are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives These once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we dont meet these people anymore We dont always even know their names as we are never presented to each other and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are Its funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such because reuniting might spoil fond memories or we dont know do they We are too afraid to check that outbr br The movie Before Sunrise just caught me watching it I never had intention to watch it through but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting I gave a look for the rest of the film I didnt know what to expect from it but nor did the young couple They had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate I believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through It makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives
0	With these people faking so many shots using old footage and gassing animals to get them out not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors whats to believe Old film of countries is nice but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films I know racism is OK in these old films but there is more to that to make this couple lose credibility Portrayed as fliers they never flew their planes Martin Johnson was an exvaudevillian used friends like Jack London for financial gain while stiffing them of royalties denying his wifes apparent depression using her as a cute prop all this makes these films unbearable They were by no means the first to travel to these lands or the first to write about them He was OK as a filmmaker and photographer but thats about it

0	I dont like using the word awful to describe any work of the cinema for which a great deal of time effort talent and money is spent in its creation but Zefferellis attempt to adapt Charlotte Brontës novel Jane Eyre is a total waste of timebr br The script is lacking in finesse and power everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms leaving little to the imagination The lead actors are woefully miscast clearly hired for their star names and the musical score drippy and dull Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all She is like a wet noodle worse even than Joan Fontaine who at least was capable of some modicum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion And William Hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy Of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any whiff of life to this flickbr br Joan Plowrights Mrs Fairfax is like some Disney creation who keeps popping up to sweeten scenes in which she would have been best left out br br There is no mystery surrounding the story of Rochesters first wife The role of the wouldbe second wife played like a Barbie Doll by Elle MacPhearson is an empty cipherbr br Fiona Shaw a very great actress is completely wasted as Janes Aunt Mrs Reed She would have been bettercast as Mrs Fairfax Only Amanda Root as Janes beloved school teacher evokes any authentic sympathy or believability br br I saw this version of Jane Eyre after viewing Robert Youngs for British television made in 1997 starring Ciaran Hinds Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones There is no comparison Youngs vital romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova compared to Zefferellis wet squibbr br I will be interested now to see the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton about which Ive read some very good things on this website I am amazed at how many people liked Zefferellis Yorkshire picture book br br About all I can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored beyond that it is a complete dud

1	Every time this film is on the BBC somebody in the Radio Times says how it is a satire against the post war world of rationing and the welfare state I do not think this is the point of the film at all The film parodies the spivssmall time criminals who ran the blackmarket and the housewives league who campaigned against government restrictions but were really a Tory front organisationbr br Yes of course the film sends up the politicalsocial situation but in the end the people realise that they need all the controls to ensure a fair societythey want to be British and muddle through rather than foreignbr br But I dont think they go back to being exactly like they were before

0	Someone will have to explain to me why every film that features poor people and adopts a pseudogritty look is somehow seen as realistic by some peoplebr br I didnt see anything realistic about the characters although the actors did their best with really bad parts or the situations Instead I saw a forced selfconscious effort at being edgy gritty and down and dirtybr br Sadly it takes a lot more than handholding the camera without rhyme or reason and failing to light the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant waybr br Its a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie theater are nowadays all carbon copies with bad cinematography nonexistent camera direction and a lot of swearing striving to pass themselves as Artbr br Its little wonder that films like In the Bedroom or About Schmidt get such raves I found them to be meandering and very average but compared to the current slew of independent clones like Raising victor Vargas they are outright brilliant and inspiredbr br A few years ago seeing an independent film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care and maybe a few technical glitches caused by the low budgets nowadays it means that chances are youll get yet another bythenumbers letsshakethecameraaroundfortwohours attempt at placating the lack of taste of independent distributors And of course all that to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and contrivedbr br Is it any surprise that the independent marketplace has fewer and fewer surviving companies Not at all when you see films like Raising Victor Vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them

1	In 1933 Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced their way through three Warner Brother musicals that offered Depression era audiences a momentary distraction from their woes Gold Diggers of 1933 42nd Street and Footlight Parade were all set in the world of Broadway Theatre with basically the same theme of the show must go on In addition to Keeler and Powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of Busby Berkeley show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting playersbr br All are arguably classics of their genre but I must admit a clear preference for Footlight due to its pace energy and lead James Cagney Warren William in Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter in 42nd Street acquit themselves admirably as the shows production heads particularly Baxter as the burned out Julian Marsh in search of one last box office smash Both lack the infectious energy of Cagney however who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a Broadway musical He is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriendbr br Of course Cagney alone does not make Footlight the classic that it is The script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring Frank McHugh Hugh Herbert Guy Kibbee and especially Joan Blondell who cuts everyone down to size Busby Berkeleys dance numbers are surreal suggestive and risqué and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the Hollywood Code in 34 Sadly the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the verve and sass of Footlight again Gentility and morality made sure of it
1	In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review this film actually was surprisingly good I reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés obvious jokes and overacting all of which the trailer had promisedbr br However after 5 minutes in I found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting With only one toilet humour gag Over Her Dead Body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and without spoiling anything too much some of the moments involving animals are hilariousbr br The staple ingredients of a good film are all there script director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy this film stands tallbr br Sure you arent going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time
1	no this is not supposed to be a high budget brilliance but it is brilliant in its own right you have to look at it for what it is a low budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist wielding a 12 inch love rod that he keeps out flapping in stride those who came to give this movie a low review were probably looking for the next cult classic or hidden gem as they say and just didnt quite get there i love how everyone points out obvious observations such as the 5 cent baby attached to a fish pole hahaha well yes i dont think a movie with a budget like this could afford good actors or effects so they worked with what they had the guts and entrails were actually very convincing the movie was a little choppy going from sequence to sequence but overall this is one of the better movies i have seen lately that doesnt follow any trend or predictability very good for a laugh
1	There can be no denying that Hak Se Wui Election in English is a well made and well thought out film The film uses numerous clever pieces of identification all the time playing with modernity yet sticking to tradition  a theme played with throughout the film Where John Woos Hong Kong films are action packed and over the top in their explosive content as seen in Hard Boiled 1992 and when Hong Kong films do settle down into rhythms of telling the story from the bad point of view they can sometimes stutter and just become merely unmemorable a good example being City on Fire 1987br br Election is a film that is memorable for the sheer fact of its unpredictable scenes spontaneous action and violence that are done in a realistic and tasteful if thats the right word manner as well as the clever little in pieces of filmmaking Its difficult to spot during the viewing but Election is really constructed in a kind of three act structure there is the first point of concern involving the actual election and whoever is voted in is voted in  not everyone likes the decision but what the Uncles say goes The second act is the retrieving of the ancient baton from China that tradition demands must be present during the inauguration with the final third the aftermath of the inauguration and certain characters coming up with their own ideas on how the Triads should and could be run Needless to say certain events and twists occur during each of the three thirds some are small and immaterial whereas some are much larger and spectacularbr br Election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third Trying to kill off time surrounding an election that only takes a few minutes to complete was clearly a hard task for the writers and filmmakers and that shows at numerous points I got the feeling that a certain scene was just starting to go somewhere before it was interrupted by the police and then everyone gets arrested This happens a few times a fight breaks out in a restaurant but the police are there and everyone is arrested theres a secret meeting about the baton between the Triads but the police show up and everyone gets arrested some other Triads are having a preelection talk but the police show up and guess what You knowbr br Once the film gets out of that rut that I thought it would it uses a sacred baton as a plot device to get everybody moving The baton spawns some good fight scenes such as the chasing of a truck after its been hotwired another chase involving a motorbike and a kungfu fight with a load of melee weapons in a street  the scenes are unpredictable realistic and violent but like I said they are in a tasteful manner Where Election really soars is its attention to that fine detail When the Triads are in jail the bars are covered with wire suggesting theyre all animals in cages as thats how they behave on the outside when in conflict Another fine piece of attention to detail is the way the Uncles toast using tea and not alcohol elevating themselves above other head gangsters whod use champagne The Long Good Friday and also referencing Chinese tradition of drinking tea to celebrate or commemoratebr br Election is a good film that is structured well enough to enjoy and a film that has fantastic miseenscene as you look at whats going on Some of the indoor settings and the clothing as well as the buckets of style that is poured on as the search and chase for the baton intensifies The inauguration is like another short film entirely and very well integrated into the film hinting at Chinese tradition in the process I feel the best scene is the ending scene as it sums it up perfectly two shifty characters fishing and debating the ruling of the Triads all the while remaining realistic unpredictable and violent in a tasteful manner of course
1	Im a huge Jane Austen fan and besides being a featurelength film a true fan wants to see as little left out as possible and that can only be achieved in a miniseries it was really great Gwyneth Paltrow really captures the slightly clueless but wellintentioned rich girl and Jeremy Northam IS Mr Knightly with his poise and nobility I wasnt thrilled with Ewan McGregor even though I like him very much as an actor but didnt feel it spoiled the movie at all Like I said as a Jane Austen fan there were things I would have liked to have seen included that werent but that would have made it much longer than permissible for a feature length film and as it was I felt they really encapsulated the story well Ive seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one
1	Saving Grace is never riotously funny but it delivers quite a few good laughs and I enjoyed it to a significant degree Brenda Blethyn is a fine actress and does a good job at portraying widower Grace who resorts to growing marijuana to pay off her massive debts The supporting cast also does a fine job French actor Tchecky Karyo has a funny little role The premise alone is appealing The idea of an overthehill woman growing and smoking pot sounds funny enough And the film plays around with the premise wisely every now and then Of course there are flat moments like one where two elderly women mistaken Graces marijuana leaves for tea leaves and they start pulling childish antics at the store where they work That was a mindless gag that didnt quite take off The films tone is downbeat and occasionally dull but I got enough laughs to give this English import a recommendation br br My score 7 out of 10

1	Wow what a whirlwind The 30s is a decade with plenty of movies of every type I can imagine especially during the early talkies phase There were movies which are painfully static and dull like Dracula with Bella Lugosi and there were those that just dont give it a rest sometimes in a good way and other times not This is one of the films that dont stop for a minute and that is both a wonder and a pity Lloyd Bacon who also directed 42nd Street must have been the king of the Depression Era musicals and he was probably excited with the possibilities sound brought to the world of cinema for he filled this picture with it There mustnt be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking Its completely crazy I was thinking the movie deserved a 5 or a 6 tops because the pacing was very poor since it was insanely fast and I sometimes didnt know what was happening and what to think The characters seemed to just running to and fro places talking about things which didnt interest me and probably no one else I thought I was just going to be rewarded with a small headache I noticed Lloyd Bacon also cast the female lead in 42nd Street Ruby Keeler and 42nd Street was a movie whose ending was the best part of it And you know what It happened the same thing with Footlight Parade The ending is absolutely incredible It has become hands down the most impressive musical I have ever seen The final part presents us some musical numbers and those are believe me something that make seeing the other rest of the movie worth The numbers are flawless There are three big bits and the most impressive is surely the second one Suddenly the screen was filled with gorgeous and inventive camera work beautiful people and plain entertainment that made me forget my small headache
0	Lynne Ramsey makes arresting images and Samantha Morton can summon feeling with a gesture So what a drag to discover their talents wasted on this mannered pretentious lark br br Ramsey cant bring Callar to life Her attempts are too arty and oblique Repeatedly her camera lingers on long silent shots of the agonizing actress as if Mortons obliterated gaze alone could supply character We are in a blank Warholian hell of selfindulgence for a film that has minutes to spare on bugs crawling across the floor you might think it could get round to fleshing out its protagonist But how will it do so if she rarely speaks Without the novels interior monologue the celluloid Morvern Callar is nobody Small wonder Ramsey has Morton undress oftenbr br That said the first ten minutes were so impressively acted shot and edited that my hopes were soaring Give the film that much it knows how to make promises if not how to keep any
0	This movie is AWFUL I dont even know where to begin Im speechless I cant even describe how awful this is The blood is flourescent first of all and the acting is AWFUL The only good part was the biker chick that saves the day This movie was rediculous I dont see how it could even get a vote of 1 its so bad It looks like it was made by highschool students
1	despite the occasionally stilted acting and seenitallbefore story this is a fairly compelling moviebr br It has suspense the scenes with the demon are actually pretty creepy some of the visual effects are superb and best of all no ridiculously ill placed humour to detract from the film as too many wannabe horror films have in them nowbr br honestly this isnt the greatest film ever made but it actually draws you in and at least makes an attempt at character developmentbr br i was glad i watched it
0	I saw this movie in its own time period when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life but stamped your child as a bastard In these days of single mothers that may seem very farfetched but it was very true And Im not crazy about laughing at someone who is stammering either Between these two problems I had difficulty finding this movie funny At that time I didnt know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had I did know who Betty Hutton was and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic I loved Bringing Up Baby but I find this movie just embarrassing Im sure the punch at some church functions probably was spiked but I was the one needing a drink after watching this again The idea the girl would have to be drunk in order to get married and get pregnant just added to the misery An entire town could turn on you under these circumstances so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part Of course shoot me I dont like Its a Wonderful Life either

1	This movie is very good The screenplay is enchanting But Meryl Streep is most impressive Her performance is excellent She brings me to go into the heart of her role
1	Im on the opposite end of the previous commentbr br First of all I dont think this was intended to be a straight sequel to The Jerk I mean its not titled The Jerk 2 its The Jerk Too which leads me to believe that while a lot of the character names are the same it actually revolves around a completely different personbr br Think about it Virtually no connection to the previous movie other than character names a totally different story different cast and the fact that its a partial musicalbr br I say give this movie some credit It does have plenty of laughs in it Mark Blankfield at his prime

0	This series just gets worse and worse Poorly written and just plain not funny The premise is excellent but the writers inexperience shines through By trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone Now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about and resorted to that patronizing smug Oh silly you style acting that comes with a no laugh script They roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say arent we zany Isnt this funny Well no its not actually Gum disease is less painful No wonder with the exception of Corner Gas Canadians generally avoid Canadian TV Come on CBC youre suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of Canadian talent Pull the plug on this amateurish mess
1	some spoilersbr br I was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms acting dated dialogue unclear storyline unfounded Belafonte is great as a Brandoesque menacing swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically illequipped from his past life to do so He learns too late how empty his hustling materialistic life was without love Mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife Fanny In spite of his prayers for a miracle his bitterness prevents him from accepting or believing in one The two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other the result being hilarious and touchingly sadbr br The perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film After looking everywhere for Belafonte Mostel looks up to see a falling feather and he frantically reaches for it as if hes finally willing to believe in angels and miracles But Belafonte wasnt allowed to finish his miracle either to restore Fannys health or Mostels faith so he never got his wings The feather floats tauntingly out of Mostels grasp a metaphor for both mens live its too late and you dont get a second chance Like Its a Wonderful life this movie is magical wonderful funny but terribly tragic
1	Ok so its not a masterpiece like the Godfather but it doesnt have to be The only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times If it can make the viewer laugh a bunch of times it has accomplished its purpose I laughed out loud and left with a smile I feel like I got my moneys worth
1	If I didnt know any better it almost seems like it was staged but it wasnt It was set up perfectly and how they got all of that footage is amazing The unfortunate events of September 11 2001 are put together well in this documentary and the classic footage that they got made this an unfortunate classic Just the history in the footage alone should make it a MUST see for any american or person touched by the tragedy of September 11
0	One of the worst films I have ever seen How to define worst I would prefer having both eye balls yanked out and then be forced to tap dance on them than ever view this pitiful dreck again Somehow OneHit Wonder Zwick manages a film that simultaneously offends Elvis fans Mary Kay saleswomen Las Vegas gays FBI agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a shoddy sloppy farce so forced it deserves to be forsaken ed How Elvis Presley Enterprises could allow the rights of actual Elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be The only good Elvis Presley Imitator is a dead one is beyond me The worst part of this mess and that takes some work is the mangled script In 1958 Elvis words and songs that he would speakperform in the 1970s are quoted Worst special effect That Oscar would go to the moron who decided that Elvis grave potentially the most photographedrecognizable grave in the world resembles a pyramid with a gold record glued atop and is situated in the middle of a park somewhere Potentially this films biggest audience would be Elvis fans However the rampant stupidity Nixon gave Elvis a DEA badge not FBI credentialsand I could go on and on actually undercuts THAT conventional wisdom Ugh I used the word wisdom to describe this stupid movie This is truly a horrible horrible film
1	I thought this had the right blend of character plot futuristic stuff and special effects without going over board It will take a while to get going but the acting was good and I was intrigued by the angel who is not to hard to look at I like the attitude too Certainly not like other attempts at futuristic stories
0	This is a good example of how NOT to make a filmbr br There is very little meaningful dialog no context for the events and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes The result is a confused clueless viewer the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the directors commentarybr br This movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is with an emphasis on child abuse It includes some stock footage of real horrible acts of violence including war time executions Although it works in the context of the movie I feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content This film is absolutely NOT for the weak stomached or the easily offended and should not under any circumstances be shown to minorsbr br The climax is anticlimactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie If youre not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss itbr br The directors commentary was a oneshot sit the guy down and let him talk no cuts type of commentary While this isnt necessarily bad the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about his college filming conditions co producers bad film and a dozen other things The constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the moviebr br The movie was shot many years ago on 16mm and Super8 film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget Because of this the video and audio quality is poor That alone does not make it a bad movie but it does make a bad movie worse
0	Before seeing this movie I wouldve said that I loved everything Kathy Bates has done Now its everythingminusone James Woods is patheticnot his character his acting Someone shouldve told him that poor is not synonymous with dirty nor ignorant nor cliche Ditto for Randy Quaids stereotyping The only redeeming feature is Henry Thomas who isnt a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess If you enjoy the country youll enjoy the scenery Thats the best I can give itbr br Im a serious fan of both independent and quirky films but this is simply terrible

0	Yes The Southern Star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner Matt Monro It pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature stunningly miscast with George Segal and Ursula Andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond Add in Harry Andrews with a strange accent no less chasing an ostrich tons of stock footage of wildlife and poorly composed and dull photography by Raoul Coutard and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of Senegal
0	This is a worthless sequel to a great action movie Cheap looking and worst of all BORING ACTION SCENES The only decent thing about the movie is the last fight sequence Only 82 minutes but it feels like it goes on forever Even diehard Van Damme fanslike myself should avoid this one
0	To be honest i had heard this was pretty bad before i decided to watch it but im never one to let others influence my viewings in fact im more likely to watch something out of defiance Bullwhip had one thing going for me before the viewing anyway the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those gorgeous eyes was in it had me interested right away The picture isnt very good and is in fact very morally dubious all the characters are corrupt and shifty in one way shape or form all motivated by greed or egocentric victories this is all well and good if the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a taut climax shuddering picture Sadly it doesnt and as the finale fills your eyes with sugar you cant help shouting out that you have been cheated into watching a pretty bad film nobody in the cast come out with any credit with lead man Guy Madison painfully wooden in the extremebr br Not even the lovely Rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone 310

1	what is wrong with you people if you werent blown away by the action car sequences and jessica Simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head Of course the film isnt a masterpiece i dont think it was aiming to be It was fun and funny i never watched the show when i was younger i only recently saw one episode and when i watched the movie i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere The movie seats were practically shaking and the car sequences were good because it didnt bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious and jessica Simpson is plain hot i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences All in all i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on DVD People enjoy it for what it is
1	Indian Directors have it tough They have to compete with movies like Laggan where 11 henpeckedCastrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots Devdas a hapless fedar festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any ones feelings or sentimentsalas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry But to make a good movie you have to tightrope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with Split skirts and DishumDishum fights preferably involving a nitwit Bollywood leading actor who is marginally handsome So you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of Leonine village head who in own words defending his Village this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience There are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like Nana Patekar Narasimhan Nana Patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the Politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him meanwhile his daughter is bathing his GrandsonThis is as authentic a scene you can get in rural India Nana Patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in Hindi Films The violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with SongDances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies wont sell a sad but true state of affairs Faster this changes better for Bollywood All said and done this is one good Movie

1	I watched Elephant Walk for the first time in about 30 years and was struck by how similar the story line is to the greatly superior Rebecca As others have said you have the sweet young thing swept off her feet by the alternately charming and brooding lord of the manor only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a largerthanlife yet deeply flawed relative You have the stern and disapproving servant a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homesteadbr br Meanwhile Elephant Walk also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to The Letter the Bette Davis love triangle set on a Singapore rubber plantation rather than a Sri Lankan tea plantationbr br Maltin gives Elephant Walk just two stars and IMDb readers arent much kinder but I enjoyed it despite its predictability Elizabeth Taylor never looked lovelier and Peter Finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father Dana Andrews a favorite in Laura and The Best Year of Our Lives is wasted as Elizabeths frustrated admirer The real star is the bungalow one of the most beautiful interior sets in movie history

0	Yet another early film from Alfred Hitchcock which seems to have been done out of contractual obligation As with Juno and the Paycock you can tell that Hitchcock had little interest in this movie There is almost no style or craft to it at all The story revolves around Fred and Emily a young married couple who come into some money and go on a cruise which proves to be a test of their marriage Emily is given a chance at a new life with a good hearted wealthy man who falls in love with her but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband This might seem more believable if Fred werent made out to be a completely insensitive pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman The couple ends up staying together but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene The third act goes in a completely different direction with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an Asian fishing boat Joan Barry does give a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband Thats about all you can say for this one
0	This movie was probably the worst movie I have ever seen Here are the things that immediately jump out at me 1 The woods were more like hills in Los Angeles with a couple trees and brush Not scary whatsoever News flash if you are filming in the Southern California area big bear is only an hour away They actually have trees therebr br 2 The writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue I have ever experienced Every possible line in the movie was unoriginal cliché or just plain stupid For instance the name of the camp is camp blood lame the name of the clown is the killer clown lame What is a clown doing in a forest anyway Was that the only mask they could find 3 The last but certainly the least was the acting Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled A virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting Worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph Its a really long scene and I guess she was supposed to be sexy but she was NOT Also and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me was this tool who is supposed to be athletic For instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them Then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very girl like run that he is quite far from athletic Oh and to the girl who played Kat good Lord stop singing That song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myselfbr br If for some reason you do see this movie I would at least recommend watching the special features The group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story In fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending Apparently she hangs out with special kids

1	Its a good thing I rented the movie before seeing the viewer rating from this site It was a wonderful movie that I will be adding to my Christmas selection The cast was wonderfully chosen and Ben Affleck plays a good leading role I would tell viewers who have not seen the movie to go ahead and buy it I rate it right up there with Christmas vacation The movie was very funny and well written and Ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well The things he says and does is just how I would imagine a person with too much money to act The movie is much funnier than The Santa Claus and Christmas With The Kranks Plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of Christmas which is you cant buy love with money
1	Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan an average man who feels God is messing up his life God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways Of course giving someone Gods powers could take a turn for the worse Bruce Almighty is a good comedy Jim Carrey is good as always Morgan Freeman is firstrate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well The jokes are almost always on target although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carreys facial expressions I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God not only that but also as a black man I thought this quite well especially with the brilliant Freeman There are some hilarious scenes the opening cookie scene for instance others miss the target slightly but still a good film 67 out of 10
0	Did anyone who was making this movie particularly the director spare a thought for the logic of the storyline These are not mere plotholes but plot graves that become ever deeper as we lose any sympathy for the main character and his plight That is if you are kind enough a viewer to valiantly ignore the fact for most of the movie that the characters are either servants to the gravehole plot or boring and unlikeable Or in the case of Downeys Hannahs characters apparently superfluous In pondering the reason for existence of Downeys characters significant screentime in the movie I decided that either the director had liked his character and unnecessarily increased his screentime unlikley as the director didnt change anything else about the script he actually needed to or that his character was going to be sacrificed on the altar of bad plotting Ill leave you to guess which one it was to bebr br I had to keep checking the cover of the DVD to confirm that this really was made by credible talents I cannot understand why Robert Altman would take this job Surely he has some power to pick and chose Actually I cant understand why anyone would take this script on except a firsttime director looking for the experiencebr br I suppose Robert Downey Jr needed the money for his habit I suppose Kenneth Branagh wanted to try a southern accent I suppose Robert Duvall was only given a few pages of the script and thought the role in isolation sounded intriguing These are the only motivations I can see that would coerce good actors to take on roles in this movie As for Robert Altman plenty of effort has gone in on his part to making the movie look fantastic I found myself noticing how he had framed such and such a scene or used the bright orange float vests in another scene to draw the eyes movements or imposed a beautiful filter to create a particular mood I do not typically notice such things in movies since most movies I bother to watch to the end actually engage me for reasons of good storytelling and interesting characters with understandable motives I watched this to the end only because some ridiculous element of optimism in myself kept looking at that DVD cover and being convinced that due to the talent involved there had to be some redeeming factor in this moviebr br Nice direction But thats not why I watch movies
0	This is one of those films that I could only sit through once Charlotte Henry is fine in fact all the actors were fine The problem was in the script the dialog the direction the editing the sets and the special effects Granted this was 1933 but it really creaked Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen Gary Cooper WC Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming The movie just clumped along with no cohesion Much of Lewis Carrols spirit humor and continuity are missing What a pity Its such a great book I would recommend Disneys 1951 version
1	This great movie has failed to register a higher rating than 5Why notIt is a great portrayal of the life of Christ without the ruthless sensationalism of The Passion of The ChristJohnny Cash did great things for God which amazingly are shunned and neglected in areas where they should matter mostlike our churchesThe film itself took less than a month to film as Johnny felt the strong presence of God guiding him through itGreat credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie which will always be cherished by its fansAt least the Billy Graham crusade rated it highly enough to use it as a prime source of education for new ChristiansThanks Fox for producing itAs Walk the Line proved that it was freakish that this man survived yet alone produced such an underrated masterpieceMovies are not canonized through popular vote as this production proves In summary I believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is forthright honestly portrayed and a great witness to the Christian faith
0	This movie starts out with a certain amount of promise but in my view begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down That this wellmeaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his familys life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their storiesbr br I found this movie average at best Art direction could have been much better as could have been cinematography The acting was good and so was Eva van der Guchts singing
1	I thought this movie was fantastic It was hilarious Kinda reminded me of Spinal Tap This is a must see for any fan of 70s rock I hope me and my friends arent like that in twenty yearsbr br Bill Nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spiritbr br Stephen Rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together but not succeeding wellbr br If you love music and were ever in a band this movie is definitely for you You wont regret seeing this movie I know I dont Even my family found it funny and thats saying something
1	I loved this film seen this evening on a movie theatre big screen The audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things and the fast pace was most enjoyablebr br I do as a singer and musical director question one section of Roby Keelers vocal in By a Waterfall The key modulated and she was suddenly singing much lower in a very mellow voice that bore no resemblance to the somewhat tinlike higher twitter voice she used in all her other vocalsbr br Does anyone know if this was overdubbed by another singer It sounds it to me I would love to knowbr br Thanks so much
1	The trailer for this movie didnt do the movie justice And while the movie didnt know what it really wanted to get across the first half of the movie being a light romance comedy and the second have a more serious romantic drama the overall impact was much better than I thought it would be This movie was more of a date movie but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be Kidman being one of my favorites of course Im biased but this movie proved to be a light sensitive if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better Three out of four stars 9502
0	Jameson Parker And Marilyn Hassett are the screens most unbelievable couple since John Travolta and Lily Tomlin Larry Peerces direction wavers uncontrollably between black farce and Roman tragedy Robert Klein certainly think its the former and his selfcentered performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film Normally I dont like to let myself get so ascerbic but The Bell Jar is one of my alltime favorite books and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy
0	I thought this movie seemed like a case study in how not to make a movie for the most part Since I am a filmmaker I give it a 2 for consistencybr br The problems remain from beginning to end with the plot being extremely predictable using bits and pieces of most if not all previous successful war stories The computer generated graphics were too much like viewing a video game at points and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story I was interested in the budget to get an idea of what he had to work with but did not find that informationbr br It seemed like this project pushed the limits of a low budget movie too far resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without their imagination being engaged The actors werent bad but the plot needs more innovation
0	The movie has several story lines that follow several different characters The different story lines dont feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at timesbr br It may sound weak and cliché but its true Youre way better of watching the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery channel with Steve and Terri Irwin Its more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is Im sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesnt give us the viewers much pleasure For a comedy it simply isnt funny enough and Steve and Terri Irwin just arent good actors not even when they play themselves Their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scenes feel long distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at timesbr br The movie had quite some potential I mean Steve Irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch so when I first heard that they were making a movie about the crocodile hunter my first reaction was brilliant The movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters The movie does has a certain entertainment value at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still I must certainly wouldnt recommend this moviebr br Watching this movie felt like a waste of time Still this movie might be watchable just once when it gets on TV on a rainy afternoon It does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potentialbr br 410
0	After perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction moviegoers There are the ones who are well read extremely literate and intelligent They know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author For many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature Considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for prepubescent teenagers Todays well read fan knows well this history and knows the great authors Asimov Heinlein Bradbury and Ellison who helped bring science fiction out of that basement In doing so they created thought provoking intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition This well informed fans are critical of anything Hollywood throws at them They are not critical for its own sake but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye As they should as Hollywoods record has been less than stellar To these fans the story must take supreme importance They cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics and non stop action sequences When the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudestbr br The second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre Look at many of the above comments that state Well I havent read the book or anything by this author Their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the Scifi channel They are extremely uncritical willing to overlook huge plot holes weak premises and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects They are in effect willing to turn off their critical thinking skills or maybe they never had them for the duration of the movie Case in point I Robot While supposedly based on Asimovs short stories and named after one of his novels it contains little of what Asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations Those of you that will run out and buy I Robot will be very much surprisedthis movie isnt even based on that story at all br br The film has enormous plot holes that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity I wont point them out I wont spoon feed you You need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself The characters which are named after many of Asimovs characters do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories The plot itself with all its action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for His belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds not their fists is vital to understanding his vision of the future In short other than the name their is very little of Isaac in anything about this movie There will always be those uncritical ie unthinking who will state The movie doesnt have to be like the book Due to the medium movies sometimes require that changes be made But what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book or books from the start What if all they took from the written work was the title This begs the question Why tarnish a great body of work by slapping its title on your vacuous piece of crap Save money and dont buy the rights to the works Title it something else Dont use the characters names Believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism In fact it wont matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him But it will upset those who read who think who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show br br I Robot like much of Hollywoods take on the genre pushes Science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago Hollywood could not do this alone It takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this
1	An excellent and accurate film McGovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off He is not afraid to tell the truth even though it might draw unfavourable reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and glossybr br Once again McGovern brings in Christopher Eccleston though not in as high a profile a role as he played in Hillsborough I found this movie as accurate well acted and well presented as Hillsborough and I applaud McGovern for his poignant unapologetic writing Well done and my hat is off to the writer the actors the production crew A great film
0	This is the worst film I have ever seenI was watching this film with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough The plot was bad and there wasnt a single likeable characterI could get more entertainment watching static I gave this movie a 1 only because the scale didnt go into negative numbers Avoid this movie at all costs
1	Man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word The comedy concerns a character called Robin Tripp played by the great Richard O Sullivan who finds himself after a wild party ending up at the home of two ladies called Jo and Chrissy Ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate The obvious ends up happening as he moves inbr br Man about the house was a precursor to Cooke and Mortimers spin off show George and Mildred which featured the 2 characters who were landlords to Jo Chrissy and Robin These two characters would actually turn out to be the linchpins of man about the house with Mildred the late and much missed Yootha Joyce in particular getting some of the best lines of the series A semiregular character was Larry Doug Fisher a useless person who was always on the scrounge and only ever came round when he wanted to borrow something and never to return itbr br The Americans did a version called threes company but it doesnt stand a chance when compared to this far funnier original Thames took a risk in producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with 2 women at a very conservative time but they should worry as the ratings at the time suggest that around 20 million people just wanted to watch a good old fashioned bit of comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script What a pity modern comedy cant reach that high standardbr br This programme is available on network DVD

0	God I was bored out of my head as I watched this pilot I had been expecting a lot from it as Im a huge fan of James Cameron and not just since Titanic I might add and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality Then again he also wrote the leaden Strange Days But the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration In all that time it barely went beyond its two line synopsis and I would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere On top of that I dont think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular ATeam episode As for Alba yes she is gorgeous of course but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie pouty and surly makes me also get bored of her gal wit an attitude schtick pretty soon You can count me out of this one Mr Cameron
1	Sitting Typing Nothing is the latest what if fest offered by Vincenzio Natali and starring David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller as two losers One is having relationship problems got canned from his job because of relationship problems and the police are out to get him because of his job and his relationship problems The other guy is a agoraphobic who refuses to go outside his home is met by a bothersome girl guide who calls on her Mom to claim she was molested when he doesnt buy cookies from him Oh yeah the police are after him too after the Mom of the girl scout call them in to arrest himbr br Man what a daybr br What if you could make all of this disappear That is the whole premise behind Nothing The two fools realize the cops the girl scout the cars the lawn the road everything disappear Theres nothing but white space This is an interesting concept I thought I also looked at the time of this 30 minutes had gone in the movie and I still had an hour left in the movie Could the 2 actors make this work and keep us entertained for 60 minutes Although the actors try 60 minutes IS a long time and there is clearly dead air in places of this movie But the two actors whom are lifelong friends with each other and the director have such great repertoire with each other that it was fun to watch for the dialogue and improve goofing around the two do There are lots of supernatural elements but its more of their response to these elements that ultimately make this film worth seeing

0	I didnt know what to expect from the film Well now I know This was a truly awful film The screenplay directing and acting were equally bad The story was silly and stupid The director could have made a smart and thought provoking film but he didnt I squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad Where was the focus to the film Where was anything in this film Christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it It was shabbily done and a waste of my money Do not see this film
1	Not to be confused with the Resse Witherspoon high school film of the same name this is a stylised look at Hong Kongs triad gangs Called election because a new leader or chairman is elected by ancient traditions every two years Two candidates are up for the position and through ego bribes and past track record the race is tense to say the least Expertly directed to introduce you to an expansive cast without ever being confusing the story twists and turns before revealing itself in all its brutal glory The Asian godfather this is not but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence Subtitled volume 1 I think its safe to say there will other instalments as we go deeper into the murky world of the triads and all their feuding and underhand business deals Either way this is a good start and if there are no sequels a great film in its own right
1	I enjoyed The Night Listener very much Its one of the better movies of the summerbr br Robin Williams gives one of his best performances In fact the entire cast was very good All played just the right notes for their characters not too much and not too little Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch Toni Collette is great as the Mom and never goes over the top Everyone is very believablebr br Its a short movie just under an hour and a half I noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version I wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the moviebr br The director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it wellbr br Do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads It is not a Hitchcockian thriller See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story told well If you go expecting Hitchcock you will be disappointedbr br My only complaint with the movie was the ending The director could have left a little more to the audiences imagination but this is a minor quibble
0	I went into this film with expectations from the hype that it would be insightful and uplifting Certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the band Wilcobr br Instead we get a lot of moping and whining about the process a dishonorable and no doubt onesided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the prima donna lead singersongwriter a gutwrenching confession by the fallen members friend for like 18 years saying the friendship had run its course and this whiny uncompelling story about how one record label hurt their feelings by dumping them only so that the band could immediately get 50 offers from other labels oh the tensionnot They tried their best to make it look like it was a strain but I suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that didnt exist This doesnt even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their newest songs shoved at us in full without any storyline insight or even a decent job at cinematography The strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watchbr br From the film this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they dont have and think theyre some kind of guardians for the art of music which they most definitely are not And I thought the music sucked and I couldnt even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the lead singerbr br I give it a 210
1	I thought this was an awesome movie The theme song is sweet Anyway the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning when everything should have been normal It was very weird and unrealistic The big cable company is mainly what Im talking about Apart from that the movie was very creative I think that all the acting was well done the actors acted out their characters personalities perfectly Everything fit together well It really is a shame that their isnt a soundtrack That would have been great Because this is a Canadian film and because it is one of my favorites I give this movie a 10 out of 10
0	For the first forty minutes Empire really shapes itself up it appears to be a strong confident and relatively unknown gangster flick At the time I didnt know why I thought it was good but now I do br br One of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful I dont mind films with psychos and things to prove a point take Jackie Brown for example but theyre all so terribly shallow in this but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment You literally feel a knot pull in your stomach Another major problem is the protagonist He is smug arrogant yet ironically enough not that bad He doesnt seem tight enough to be a drugdealing woman killer The fact is at the end of the day this film is completely pretentious Not slick not clever just dull and meaningless this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs br br out of 1 out of 5

0	I saw Paris Je TAime because a friend really wanted to see it so I went along with him Going in I was indifferent about the film but leaving the theater I really regretted wasting 2 hours of my life sitting through this tepid production The stories are almost completely forgettable except for the fact that most of them were awful What do Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara have to do with Paris The endless parade of American actors most definitely gave this French film a remarkably nonFrench feel The clichés about Paris were endless Yes most of them were playing with clichés about Paris but by spending so much time making fun of French clichés they directly and regrettably promoted them once more Yes Paris is the city of love We get itbr br The worst segments were the one directed by Wes Craven Oscar Wilde the one with Nick Nolte the mime one the worst the hair products one the one with Juliette Binoche Willem Dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of Paris the vampire one When I think of Paris I think of Elijah Wood The one with Natalie Portman which really looked like a Mentos commercial and it was stupid the blind young man should know Portman was just playing a part when she called him On and on it went It felt endlessbr br I didnt like the Coen Bros one as well It really plays with those Parisien clichés but I didnt find it funny Just annoying The Gus Van Sant one was interesting but it was so slight and the punchline was obvious that it barely registeredbr br There were only two successful segments and they were the one about the immigrant nanny who leaves her baby at a kindergarten only to babysit a baby for a rich woman Nice irony there And the segment about the African who is stabbed Its the best segment in the whole film but this segment has nothing to do with Paris The story could have taken place in any city around the worldbr br The last segment the one with the chubby middle aged woman was sorta interesting too but the underlying tone was bad They wanted to celebrate her limited grasp of French but the segment came off as being condescendingbr br The whole project felt forced and uninspired Almost like the French government sponsored this film to promote tourism All in all with only about 10 to 15 minutes of interesting stuff Paris Je TAime was an awful cinematic experience

1	I personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the ratings some people have given it It is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated now if you dont like comic books or animation then of course you wont like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me Though if you are a fan of Interesting strong characters and heroicsexy women kicking butt and saving the worldhell you will love this movie I thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie Quite animeesque or more like some of the American movies following this new trend of adult animation Like Titan AE meets the live action version of Punisher In the end I highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie
1	An angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather Together they find common ground in the Gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders Although tragic episodes such as the Highland clearances feature in the stories there is a surprising amount of humour and gaiety in them Its all filmed in Skye so there is a double dose of beauty The mountain scenery is breathtaking and its a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic spoken Im English so I had to read the subtitles but the sound of spoken Gaelic is nonetheless wonderful The performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen nonactors in other words you are watching the real thing people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history The Gaelic community especially on Skye worked innumerable minor miracles to make this film Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic folk history folk music oral culture Scotland British history multiculturalism or social justice should go and see this film

1	This is one of those feel good Saturday afternoon movies Its right up there with other retro flicks like Flight of the Navigator Just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up And its fun to see how 20 years has changed the stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson Not to mention Joquin Phoenixbr br I personally really like movies like this from time to time Nothing too deep or too scary Just a nice story line And I would have never known Mr Phoenix had I not recently read the credits He was just a baby really when he made this moviebr br Kelly Preston was quite the young budding actress then too She and Lea did a wonderful job in this movie I agree its not an Oscar caliber movie But very much worth watching Especially if you have kids in the lets say 8 to 11 year old range Or ones that are interested in the space program

1	This a good episode of The New Twilight Zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories I note both of them are based on short stories Examination Day is set in the future year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves huge TVlooking phones that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain ageand the Examination Day a point where 12yearolds must undergo a governmentrequired IQ test The kid is this story Dickie Jordan David Mendenhall is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid so is calm even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades His parents Christopher Allport and Elizabeth Norment on the other hand say he shouldnt have used his birthday wish on getting a good score and while their reason includes that they believe hes capable and he should have no need to worry its pretty obvious they are worried I wont give anything away in the ending but I will say this theres a point where we get a glimpse of whats to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject that evening or another his parents ask Dickie whether hed prefer to watch TV all night By todays standards wed be pleased hed say hed rather read and not just because theres nothing worth watchingbut why would his family ask this The flavor of whats encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from Harrison Bergenon which I hear hasnt received a great adaptation to the screen I only wish they couldve provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as The Obsolete Man was I found it to be better than the short story it was based on I havent read the one that A Message from Charity was based on but would like to since it was interesting a 16yearld boy Peter Robert Duncan McNeill is suffering a fever from unclean water that has always been common in his Massachusetts hometownbut he is able to see through the eyes of a young Puritan woman suffering the same type of fever Charity Payne Kerry Noonann who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him They both recover especially since its common for that to happen in 1985 but the connection doesnt go away Charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each others company especially Peter who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students even at the college hes been staying in one place at Things take an unexpected turn though when Charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from England as a sign of bewitchment added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever not so common in 1700 The two try to learn a way to save her The ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching Both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times through a lessonwarning that sounds like something Rod Sterling wouldve cooked up and entertainment make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship love and wisdom do a great deal Probably 34 of this has no theme but somehow I think it all would have been approved by Sterlings crew
0	This really should deserve a O rating or even a negative ten I watched this show for ages and the show jumped the shark around series 7 This episode however is proof that the show has jumped the shark Its writing is lazy absurd selfindulgent and not even worthy of rubbish like Beavis and Buttheadbr br It is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun Pirates of the Caribbean the Mummy Count of Monte Cristo all fun movies that are not to be taken seriously However there is such thing as ridiculous as in this is the worst thing Ive ever seen And indeed this is the worst episode of Stargate Ive ever seen Its absolutely dreadful and this coming from someone with a stargate in her basementbr br Makes me want to sell all of my stargate props most seriously
1	Charming doesnt even begin to describe Saving Grace its absolutely irresistible Anyone who ventures into this movie will leave with their spirits soaring high hahabr br Grace Trevethyn Brenda Blethyn has just lost her husband but her problems are about to get a whole lot worse Her dearly departed has left her with no money and outstanding debts Faced with losing everything she has to find out a way to get a lot of cashfast She gets an idea when her gardener Matthew Craig Ferguson asks the townfamous horticulturist to give him advice on a plant he is secretly growing Grace immediately realizes that his plant is marijuana so they decide to use her gardening skills to grow a lot of topquality weed and then sell it to pay off her outstanding debtsbr br The most notable quality about Saving Grace is its likability Every character is extremely sympathetic and save for the first 20 or so minutes the film is nonstop good cheer Everyone wants a happy ending for everyone even if it means turning a blind eye to some rather illegal activitiesbr br The acting is topnotch Brenda Blethyn is one of Britains finest actresses and here is why She turns what could have been a caricature into a fully living and breathing individual Shes a nice lady but shes not stupid Craig Ferguson is equally amiable as Matthew Hes a deadbeat loser but hes so likable that it doesnt matter The rest of the ensemble cast fits in this category as well but special mention has to go to Tcheky Karyo The French actor always has a aura of menace about him and that suits him well but he also has great comedy skillsbr br Nigel Cole finds the perfect tone for Saving Grace Its all about the charm One of the problems I have with British humor is that all the energy seems to be drained out of the film Not so here The film is thoroughly likable and always amusing Thats not to say that Saving Grace is just a likable movie that will leave you with a grin and a good feeling While this movie is not an out and out comedy it does boast two or three scenes that are nothing short of hystericalbr br If theres any problem with the film its that the climax is a little confusing The questions are answered though and the ending boasts an unexpected twistbr br See Saving Grace especially when youre having a bad day
0	I actually intended to see this movie in the theatre It was actually sold out I actually went to see Solaris instead which actually was the worst movie to be released in 2002br br Victor Rosa John Leguizamo a tough streetwise street pharmacist freaks out when he sees a kid get shot so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with Jack Peter Sarsgaard Things seem to be going pretty well until Jack skips town with his girlfriend Trish Denise Richards This happened very late in the movie so had they not revealed this in the preview it might have been an interesting twist But they did so its notbr br In fact theres not a single interesting thing about this movie everything is given away in the preview If you saw even one preview you saw the whole movie so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps Go to the website download the preview save yourself 399 There is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film other than how terrible the soundtrack isbr br I hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired Twice Most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan duets and I may shatter the fabric of the spacetime continuum with a concept as mindnumbing as this they both had less talent and musical abilitybr br The acting is at best poor the script is at best a crime against humanity and Denise Richards is at best 67 styrofoam and 33 ziploc bag You know things are bad when John Leguizamo he was in The Pest upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities
0	This is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the West Indies and it stars Puddy from the Seinfeld show Patrick Warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and hes noticeably slimmer here Oliver Reed got top billing but hes hardly in the film at all Warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him Eartha Kitt plays an owner of a bordello and theyre is so much nudity in the film If its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having theyre turn with him Then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and theres the bloody standoff No real political message like the film Burn but just another contrived plot device to move the story along Incredibly they made a sequel and Warburton and all the rest of the cast came back I hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad The nudity keeps it watchable and Warburtons lack of any accent make it at times laughable Very bad film but I got to admit that I want to see the sequel
1	House of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part A psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the gamebr br Have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong Watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way Sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators Youre never sure of who is exactly who in this moviebr br This is both a quality and a drawback of the script As the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency But all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological developmentbr br This is definitely one of the best movies about gambling
1	I can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience The imagination on display the visual interpretation of the script the humor is constantly surprising The two leads are great and really carry the film My advice would be to not even watch a trailer just rent the film and watch without expectations I rented from blockbuster so it is readily available in brisbane not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and thats always good unless its just that was stupid I loved this film you just dont get to see gems like this every day This should become a cult favorite Give it a try you may just feel the same way about it as i do
0	Okay just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie Well at least I did It started out good but became so boring after the first half hour spoilerbr br It tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants The only problem is that her daughters friend is the girl in the way She always wins the competitions therefore pushing the mother further towards eliminating her After talking to a hitman the mother decides that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit So actions are taken but she eventually gets caughtbr br The cast is awful and the movie drags on too long with nothing happening Dont waste your time watching thisbr br
0	The mind boggles at exactly what about Universal Soldier merited a sequel Since the real star Dolph Lundgren would not be able to reprise his role from the original there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax writeoff Bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler Bill Goldberg and martial arts expert Michael Jai White To their credit they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement Bill Goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role For once his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times and it does not get irritating The problem from the audiences point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes Lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films And therein lies the problem You do not go to see a Van Damme film because you want serious action You go because you want comedy however unintentionalbr br Unbeknownst to many people Universal Soldier was followed by two directtovideo sequels I have only seen the first which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke Matt Battaglia was so terrible in the role of Luc Deveraux that for once in his career the sight of JeanClaude Van Damme comes as a welcome relief The film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned directtovideo sequels and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original After years of investigation and explanation the Unisol project is still going ahead with some minor modifications For one the new Unisols are stronger and more damageresistant than their earlier cousins For another all of the Unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called SETH In the early parts of the film SETH exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass domebr br Being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut The Unisol project is on the chopping block which essentially means that SETH will be turned off SETH somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained decides to mobilise the Unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down His only problem is that every so often a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown Two individuals possess the code in question SETH kills the first in short order and those who are familiar with the plot kit that Van Dammes films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be The rest of the film revolves around the Unisols attempts to get the code out of Van Damme without injuring him too badly A subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film but it adds about as much to the story as Van Damme does to the profession of actingbr br The film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichés When SETH transplants his command module into the body of Michael Jai White we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over He goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanitys weaknesses Gee SETH you mean they will not be our strong points All kidding aside the short length of the film is both the films weakness and its strength It leaves the action without adequate setup In the original we are given a very thorough explanation of the Unisols how they work and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film Here the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a Unisol is and how they operate At least in the original a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice Here one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform and presumably his body getting up every time without stopping for breathbr br I tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner If you can see it on the cheap knock yourself out This is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of Mystery Science Theatre

1	Stargate SG1 is a spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie Stargate I am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject The show gets it rolling from the very first episode a retired Jack ONeill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion Dr Daniel Jackson Through the first two episodes we meet Samantha Carter a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her and there is Tealc a quiet compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team br br The main bad guys are called the Gouald they are parasites who can get inserted into ones brain thus controlling them and doing evil deeds Any Gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a System Lord The warriors behind the Gouald are called Jaffa who house the parasitic Gouald in their bodies until the Gouald can get inserted in a persons brainbr br Through the episodes we mostly get to see SG1 the exploratory team comprised of JackDanielTealcand Sam go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets this device is called the Stargate and they encounter new cultures or bad guys Some episodes are onworld meaning that they do not go through the Stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on Earthbr br Through the years you start to see a decline in the SG1 team as close knit and more characterbuilding story lines This in turn means even more onworld episodes which is perfectly understandablebr br My rating 87510While most of this show is good there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years But still top notch science fiction

0	CIA CodenameAlexa is an absolute horrible rip off of Luc Bessons classic film La Femme Nikita1990 The film is basically about a woman who is taken in and trained by the CIA and is forced to do a secret mission for them Pretty much the same story structure of La Femme Nikita The acting combo of Lorenzo Lamas and OJ Simpson is perhaps the worst in cinema history Lamas acting is simply a bad Steven Segal impersonation Watching Orenthal act in this film is an excruciating experiencebr br The writing and acting is so poor in this film at times it is laughable There are so many action movie conventions in the film it is ridiculous unnecessary car explosions people flying thru glass windows terrorists bad ponytails etc The musical score resembles David Michael Franks score for Hard to Kill 1990 which furthers the Steven Segal theme of this movie There is plenty of martial arts in the film and it is pretty well done for a low budget American production The mindless action and over the top acting never lets up and I have to admit I was mildly entertained br br Lorenzo Lamas had the look of an action star back in the early 90s but he is certainly no action star that is why he is doing soap operas and not action blockbusters My recommendation is that you skip CIA CodenameAlexa and check out La Femme Nikita instead
0	Dire Just dire The script is contrived the acting painful and the story just drags along It is without a doubt a celebration of Sally Potter and little else This wouldnt be so bad but shes the director writer and star of the film and so is just selfglorification I found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters and the ending came not a moment too soon It has two redeeming features First is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely particularly in Paris and look rather good in black and white Secondly whether youre a fan of tango or not the music is by and large excellent except where Sally starts singing Watch this film at your own risk or if you need an unintentional laugh I am sure it appeals to someone Statistically it has to
0	This movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie Ive ever seen And thats saying a lot considering Ive seen such stinkers like Demon of Paradise Lovers Lane and Bloody Murder which is a close second However I love bad horror movies and as you can tell from my username this one really sticks out At times theres nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick As for this film the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film The acting is nonexistent and most of the camera shot are of womens areas shrink wrapped in spandex The policeman was the most stonefaced monotone actor Ive ever seen The bestworst part of this movie however has to be the murder weapon A giant safety pin What were they thinking Whos the killer A disgruntled Huggies employee Id have to give this movie an overall zero but darned if I didnt have a blast watching it
1	Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of the Toronto Second City cast She has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in Canada Finally someone has the sense to create a show for her The supporting case seems quite good too I have now watched the pilot several times and I still find it refreshing Though I am not sure why the show is listed as The Jane Show 2004 I might be wrong But as far as I am aware the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada in early 2006 It is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well Too bad this couldnt be paired up with Corner Gas Now I know Corner gas is on CTV but the two shows would be great companion pieces

1	Words can hardly describe it so Ill be brief The Thief of Bagdad was my favorite movie as a child and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me I loved this film from the first moment I saw it when I was a boy of six who had started reading The Arabian Nights I remember walking into the TV room in the middle of Sabus battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiledbr br Rarely has so much beauty magic and wonder been captured on film Sabu and John Justin are superb as the dashing heros Conrad Veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain Jaffar and Rex Ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie Georges Perinals photography is some of the best use of Technicolor One of the three credited directors is Michael Powell a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films including A Matter of Life and Death aka Stairway to Heaven and The Red Shoes He is one of the true masters of the camera right up there with David Lean Akira Kurosawa and Orson Wellesbr br As with all great works of art the beauty of The Thief of Bagdad lies in the detail Every frame has its own magical charm The story never lags and the characters and their actions are always involving Here is a film that will never grow old
1	I thought I should qualify my position after reading other reviews The movie is not great but it has a lot of great elements The lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great The story is slow and weak but entertaining The acting is bad but no worse than you will find on the SyFy Channel The music is pretty good and the gore is good It has the great Leather Face in the film and is produced by Bruce Campbell I watched the complete movie and while mostly predictable it was still enjoyable The women are attractive enough and the lead actor does a good job of being brooding and creepy The movie was remarkably clean for a modern film and the violence appropriate for children 13 and up There was no sex scenes I gave it 7 out of 10 and I think that is fair I would watch it again if I had nothing better to do The gay sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the film the devil is quite creepy
1	The French Naudet brothers did something nobody else did they had a video camera the day that this tragedy happened They were in Building 2 when you could see papers drifting down people hitting the ground from jumping from such a heightbr br I mean it goes as far as when both buildings collapsed they went running their camera was still running when the white dust covered them they found a shop doorway and got inside but all this footage is real and I think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for usbr br Ten stars goes to the Naudet brothers that filmed this extraordinary film that I watch every 911 so Ill never forget what this country went through I believe if I remember right it shows the first death of the priest of the firefighters while he was being carried to the church and his honorable funeral
0	I am a youth pastors wife and we took some youth to see this film We then spent an hour trying to explain it to them They didnt get it and I didnt enjoy it It is based on a concept that has run through all three of the major religions of the world the Bible Code the Torah Code and the Code in the Koran and is so questionable as to be laughable This is not a step forward for Christians in the arts it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door
0	I grew up on the Superman II theatrical version S2T and as a kid I loved it more than Part I since not only did it contain more Superman and three Supermantype villains it started off with a bang  the best Clark Kent to Superman transformations and rescue scenes Kids no longer had to impatiently wait for Superman to appear on screen as in part I Now as an adult I can see how the mighty had fallen with S2T See my review Ive always heard of the backstory on how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the originals director Richard Donner from part II It must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously now its common Back to the Future and Matrix 2 3 for example Unfortunately after finally seeing the Richard Donner Cut or S2RD I still cant fully recommend it Gone was the great Superman change scene the entire Paris rescue as was the wonderful recap of part I in S2Ts opening In fact they all but wrote the words Previously on Superman in S2RD The special effects werent great in either Part I or S2T but S2RD they were mostly downright laughable  such as Lois falling from the Daily Planet window I will admit some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures such as any scene in the honeymoon suite Overall if you grew up on S2T as I did and loved it as a child  not nitpicking as I do as an adult you should absolutely see S2RD as its almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes Spoiler alert Unfortunately the worst change comes last gone was also the weird amnesia kiss from S2T replaced with the exact same ending as I This is not only a lazy unoriginal copout it doesnt make sense on why Clark would go back to that diner if those events never actually happened And will he continue to turn back time for every confrontation

0	this may be a bit on the spoilerish side I would like to start by saying I did not watch the entire movie nor could I because it was evident from the first hour that I was going to be incredibly disappointed That of course is the problem with taking what many believe to be an amazing book and turning it into a Disney MadeforTV moviebr br A Wrinkle in Time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago Its got a great storyline that could hook children and adults Plus its got built in quality sequels But Disneyfying was not the way to go The problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book It is a complicated and emotional story for kids There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely psychic because that was the easiest way of explaining it There was no reason to write a fight between the three Mrs Ws as added tension there is enough tension in the story without that There was no reason to remove Megs glasses that deprived us of what couldve been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg that happens in the bookbr br I could nitpick for days about little things but I also think larger things like the art direction was a off Take for instance the way they made Camazotz look with its strangely darkened skies The creepiness that comes across in the book is that Camazotz could be Earth It looks like earth It has people on it that look like humans The skies are blue the grass is green and there are children playing But something is a little bit off The directors chose to make Camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie The lesson of course is that Camazotz could very well be Earth that is if we forget how to love It wouldve been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as theyre walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythmbr br I unfortunately did not watch the end Maybe someone can tell me how Disney messed up the end as wellbr br Overall an artistic disappointmentbr br

1	I like cheap perfume better it doesnt last as long Ralph Meekers convict character Lawson tells this to Barbara Stanwycks Helen character after he gets a whiff of the perfume that she picked out wher husband in Tijuana This line cracked me up and also seemed like a metaphor for this film that cheap is better than expensive because a cheap perfumeloving man who has a way with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have around in the long run I agree with some of the other comments posted about Helens attraction to Lawson Even though her narration states that she wants Lawson to be put away she did seem attracted to his fiery nature and that passion he stirred up in her wouldnt likely wash away with the tide
0	Ill keep this short thanks to Greg for helping me to put this succinctly Captivity is about a guy who drugs a girls drink imprisons and tortures her then poses as a captive to have sex with her That is the single twist and punchline of the film Its torture as slow motion date rape And its not even a good movie Its not so bad its good its just badbr br It should also be mentioned that among critics there is a spoiler code that they dare not break even though some were tempted to on this one because it is so vile Why NO ONE had the cojones to step up and say this is garbage and this is why is beyond mebr br Dont give your money to these pooppeddlers
1	I must admit when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as Steamy Romance I was a little bit skeptical Steamy In a movie from 1968 I was prepared for disappointment And when I realized it was shot entirely in black white I knew my erotic hopes were dashedbr br Boy was I wrong Not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance the discovery of first love fear of the secret being found out a sudden unexpected end but at times this movie was downright erotic You will soon forget that it is shot in black white The cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years And the performances from the two stars Essy Persson and Anna Gael are intense and memorable OK so theyre both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls Its 1968 Do you really expect teenagers from the 60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this Many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then Anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too muchbr br I think this movie was way ahead of its time The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shownbr br I have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here As for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action Although it wont be all you expect I dont think youll be too too disappointed

1	quote by Nicolas Martin nicmart from Houston TX Fine film but DVD reformatted for TV 8 April 2002 This is a charming and emotive film On the other hand the DVD I purchased has been reformatted to fit your TV by the clods at Columbia Tristar There is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format except that Hollywood treats all films like the moronic disposable trash that it is so used to producing What a shamebr br What a criminal shame indeed However there is another version out though See here for details httpwwwdvdbeavercomfilmDVDCompare2kingofmaskshtmbr br Wonderful performances by the two main actors The King and Doggie BTW
0	There are so many incorrect statements in this socalled documentary that I found myself shouting at the televisionbr br Bart Sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking DVD but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claimsbr br He relies on either being inaccurate not telling the full story or the old favourite government always lies to us innuendos and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claimsbr br Whats more his exclusive or unreleased footage is freely available over the internet from various sitesbr br Further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews and has used creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinionsbr br All of the claims made by Mr Sibrel about inaccuracies mistakes or whistleblowing in the Apollo programme have been thoroughly disprovenbr br How do I get that 40odd minutes of my life back
0	Come on lets get real The Knights of Christ Ordo Templi or the Knights Templar as they are more commonly called did not even exist until the early 12th century The story is so laughable that its pathetic Dolph Lundgren just looked positively bored And besides if you wanted to have a reallife Templar why not just use the Knights of Christ who are still in existence in Portugal At least they should have taken history into account The only redeeming quality I could find in this movie was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to pass for medieval or Gothic period pieces The acting was bad the storyline appalling the action horrible and the props were okay
0	This was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a childrens comic I gave it 2 out of 10 for its attention to detail because for the most part it had a 70s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the makeup was goodbr br This was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally usually seen in one of their biographies No interviews with surviving cast members crew members production team members etc or their friends families and any biographers of those people In fact I know just as much now about the programme as I did before I watched this film that was based on the supposedly biographical book As for actually learning something that noone knew about the program and wasnt common knowledge well that never happened
1	Now this show looks like most of the other shows of its type from the mid90s but the only thing is about this one is that its different they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too I personally thought it was a good show I cant understand why would they cancel it The good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since 1997 up to datebr br My hopes is that the WB bring back the show or even do a movie which I know is gonna be impossible to do but hey it doesnt hurt to dream doesnt itbr br Anyway I would recommend if you hadnt seen it to find the DVD of all 13 episodes because the characters are great the story lines are good the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great
1	In August 1980 the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents Lindy and Michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation The media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood What followed was a gross miscarriage of justicebr br Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that while camping near Ayers Rock central Australia that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area Noone believed them Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and Michael as an accessory after the fact The whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing The Chamberlains trial was over before it beganbr br Lindy never proved her innocence so she was found guilty There was never enough evidence to convict her yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure How could we as a nation even sit in judgement From where we are how could we possibly presume to know Unless there was absolute proof and no reasonable doubt whatsoever the Chamberlains should have been acquittedbr br Fred Schepisis film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of John Brysons novel that the Chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them That in fact a dingo did take baby Azaria on that fateful night at Ayers Rockbr br Schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation hell bent on the truth being brought to light He shows Australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the Chamberlains pay His screenplay cowritten with Robert Caswell vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurredbr br The outstanding Meryl Streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts She brings to life most convincingly the tough little Aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight Even her accent is almost but not quite spot on A very good effort by the master of that trade Sam Neill is every bit as good as Streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned Michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart and he starts to question his Christianity His as was Streeps is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly The entire support cast are also excellent with some of Australias finest actors and actresses playing a partbr br Technically the film is brilliant too with Director of Photography Ian Baker capturing this great land with splendour especially the Rock Editor Jill Bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged while Bruce Smeaton provides a telling scorebr br For all Aussies this is a must see a shocking look in the mirror if you will at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served and the truth to be known As Michael Chamberlain said I dont think anybody really understands what innocence meansto innocent peoplebr br Saturday May 20 1995 Videobr br Even on return viewings Fred Schepisis account of the travesty of justice that befell the Chamberlains who lost baby Azaria at Ayres rock in 1980 is still emotionally powerful and honestly movingbr br Schepisi and Robert Caswell have expertly transferred John Brysons novel to the screen telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for Michael and Lindy Chamberlain whose new born daughter Azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put downbr br Amid media speculation and vicious public rumour Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and Michael was charged as an accessory after the fact What followed was little more than trial by media and with the Australian people determined she be put away Lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidencebr br Meryl Streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles Australia head on to prove her innocence She is truly awesome and the only thing that fails her is a true blue Aussie accent though she does her level best to sound ocker You might wonder why a top Australian actress wasnt cast in the role but star power is probably the answer Alongside Meryl is an equally impressive Sam Neill outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes while he feels powerless to do anything about it A strong Aussie cast lend compelling supportbr br Editing from Jill Bilcock is very timely Ian Bakers cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and Bruce Smeatons music is perfect for the part Truly a must for all conscientious Australiansbr br Sunday June 15 1996 Video
0	The real shame of The Gathering is not in the bad acting nor is it in the despicably shallow plot The real shame is that it was far worse than the series it begun even though it did have one main attraction Takashima I would love to see Laurel Takashima in a room with Susan Ivanova even for just five minutes She has that sarcasm that wit that doubleedged personality that is at once volatile and lovable Sadly though the Babylon 5 pilot movie has an incredibly dull story involving assassination Patricia Tallman who never seriously returned to the series until much later fortunately got much better with age as Lyta Alexander who here is little more than a whiny tiresome telepath I shall leave you with one final thought why is it that Delenn looks like some sort of outerspace frog man even though she is a woman Thank heavens for the way the Minbari looked later in the show
0	On Steve Irwins show hes hillarious He doesnt even try to be funny and he just is but his movie wasnt even what I would call a movieI mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him hes just saying Oh this is one nasty bloke and looking straight into the camera He put his face in the camera too much And then when the guy falls off the car wouldnt you expect him to be dead And Terri had the worst acting Id ever seen Like when the crocodile almost ate Steve she just says Steve She didnt sound scared or anything it was just Steve I mean I hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing I love Steve Irwin but his movie was just too stupid

0	My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie Impressive cast  even for the supporting characters none of which helps this movie really I have to admit though Tom Hanks cameo almost made it worth it  what was that about Tom Did you lose a bet The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though by far a classic The premise is good Basingers character struggling with existence as a Pink Lady is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales This happens as Corbetts character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be exwife motivated by what else extortion As they both make their way they have numerous runins with Elvis impersonators who on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas Soon the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer Unfortunately premise doesnt mean the movie was goodbr br When watching this movie imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity arent really important It is much more enjoyable to just watch Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesnt really make sense The movie tries hard but ultimately falls way way way short Ultimately it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funnybr br It isnt the worst but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this one Dont say I didnt warn you
0	This movie deserves more than a 1 But Im giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a 10 resulting in it getting a rating thatll take it into the top 100 list Seriously its not that great its not that bad Its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys its ridiculous These are the types who probably still laugh at Chuck Norris jokes and still say Im rick james btch No matter how old or annoying it gets I dread having to hear Im tired of MFn snakes on this MFn plane months from now from idiots trying to be funny Its crappy plot crap acting etc Its Okay to love a bad movie but you still gotta admit its a bad moviebr br Wait for the Marine starring John Cena if you wanna see a real movie
1	I became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other I have ever watched That may be because I can see the characters as my own grandparents attempting to make sense of a world at war The ending and use of Pachabels Cannon are both amazing
1	Does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film I LOVE it One of my Top 10 films of all time It just makes me feel good I watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over Bebe Benson Michelle Johnston is THE babe of the film IMHO I never saw the play but I get angry when I read reviews that say the play was better than the film The two are like apples and oranges The film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work I believe its only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen arent changed more than they are This is a very good film it is very satisfying Thats all you need to know
1	Yes this movie is predictable and definitely not awardmaterial But then it doesnt try to be anything it is not A funfilled romp with real funny oneliners a stellar and very funny performance by Peter OToole a grounding and down to earth performance from Joan Plowright The bands performance was on the spot each one playing their role in a deft comical manner The music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely From some of the negative comments I deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads A good example is the comment about the strange baseballlike game well my dear American that was cricket from which baseball is derived and the explaining of it to the ignorant US band was very funny for those that do know cricket Also no you were not supposed to wince when Carl broke a window it was funny how Lord Foxley said oh yes to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time oh no also referring to the money Jeez it seems that every joke must be explained to some people Allinall I enjoyed it and had some great laughs Well worth seeing
1	Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait I happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning First Pachelbels Canon brought a lump to my throat then the sight of a Tiger Moth which my grandfather my father and I have all flown produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then Crowes name hooked me completely I was entranced by this film Crowes performance again the subject matter and yes what a debt we owe how various matters were addressed and dealt with the flying sequences my father flew Avro Ansons too the story and as another contributor pointed out Crowes recitation of High Flight I wont spoil the film for anyone but separated from my wife by 4000odd miles as an exarmy officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot I admit to crying heartily a couple of times Buy it rent it download it beg borrow or steal it but watch itbr br PS Did I spy a Bristol Blenheim in yellow training colourson the ground Looked like a twinengine aircraft with a twin303 Brownings in a dorsal turret
0	Only a handful of the segments are engaging here A segment with a garage attendant from Nigeria is heartbreaking One with Fanny Ardent Bob Hoskins makes its point twist by twist until the final shot overplays things br br The problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke Paris The others are so scattershot in theme tone volition production that you may as well be watching The Years Best Commercials 2006 Its really all over the place It doesnt develop over its running time and nothing reigns the directors in No construct successfully joins the pieces tedium sets in Im at the one hour twenty minute point and Elijah Wood is in some dumb overcommercial overproduced vampire shtick It has about as much to do with Paris as old ladies knitting in the Antartic Fantasy shows up I think first in the Coen Brothers segment Uh thanks J E for ruining another movie and then makes way too many appearances The point of being in Paris is that you dont need makebelieve crap to make your days extraordinary Why divide it by neighborhood if Quartier de la Madeleine is equated with vampires for some loser director Has there ever been a genre more overrepresented than the vampire film Every three years we get the same lame vampire clichésbr br Making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty artless The transitions get lost This doesnt feel intentional it feels sloppy
0	I rented this movie from the library its hard to find for good reason purely out of curiosity Im a huge Plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment The Bell Jar 1979 is by far one of the worst movies Ive ever seen The script is horrible not because it strays from the original novel text but because it strays without focus or intent The scenes are illconstructed and dont lead the viewer anywhere Whats with the hokey voice over of Plaths poetry Lady Lazarus has little do with Greenwoods situation Plaths poetry was completely misused Marilyn Hassett is completely unbelievable as Esther Greenwood or any 20 year old for that matter partly due to casting she was 32 during filming the age Plath was when she DIED and partly due to the fact that she cant act Hassett is all emotion no craft no skill The direction is mediocre the director simply covers whats there which isnt much The only reason Im giving the film a 1 is because 0 isnt an option Sorry Sylvia youll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting

1	What would you expect from a film titled Surviving Christmasand presented as festive fun something like Ghandi or English patient There are lots of things I love about this film its funny it is very well cast and it is superbly written I came to the film as a KaplanElfort fan but was dubious when I read the plot it sounded ridiculous But the film doesnt come across like that because Affleck as Drew Latham plays his part perfectly one minute a childlike adult the next a mature man who realises he has gained everything in life apart from what he really wants In fact we see Latham grow up in this film when he encounters the problems of those he envies and realises that their lives are not so good he sees that his own lot is not so badbr br This film has fewer weak or dud scenes than many other comedies I have seen Comedy is so much harder than any other type of drama it either works or it doesnt and very few comedy writers get it correct every timeI particularly loved the drama scene where the family take to reading parts written by Latham The pleasure is in the reaction of Tom Valco James Gandolfini and the comments of Brian Valco Josh Zuckerman It is the dilemma of the greedy Tom Valco who has to bite his tongue wear silly hats or sing to the Christmas tree in order to earn the prize money that keeps the film moving along wellbr br The addition of daughter Alicia Christina Applegate into the story brings a delightful romantic angle and why not in a Christmas film Of course its corny and contrived hes rich and handsome shes beautiful and single and so inevitably her and Afflect end up falling over together in the snow and finding themselves face to face Great One thing I would have liked was more use of festive music to boost the atmosphere but I cant really complain I got what I wanted
1	This film was seen by my wife and I when it came out in 1978 It was a revelation to us We actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children Obviously we were wrong Love may come from where you dont expect it and maybe dont want it But we both chose that love anywaybr br And no it never changed our sexual orientation That kind of stuff is for the Christian wackosbr br When we were young we both had affairs but never with the opposite sex As we aged we stopped having extramarital affairsbr br This story is not far fetched However the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me My wife and I have been sleeping together for the last 40 years We are still gay End of story
0	They changed the title of this atrocity to An Unexpected Love The only thing worse is the film itself The script contains dialogue that would be laughed out of a third grade play recital At one point when the wife leaves the husband a bad cover of All by Myself plays over the soundtrack No kidding The actors try but are defeated by the inept unbelievably terrible script Direction is staggeringly bad No wonder Lifetime has such a bad reputation How do things like this get made Im turning off the television before its over

0	Check out the films website more time was put into making that than in the writing of the script for this movie It couldnt be more off in its boasting Original story Original They must have found the script tucked away between the old testament or face legal repercussion for that bit of horntooting Highend special effects Come on I could do better with an Atari 7600 and a jug of earwax Stylish cinematography Oh yes the Americas funniest home video look is still a classic Im sure they had little money available for this title so of course the sf arent really that good or a bit bad now and then or just plain hilarious but its the story that makes this film a waste of time and money 4 stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of seenbefores and donealreadys
1	Fastpaced funny sexy and spectacular Cagney is always terrific Blondel charms you with her wit and energy Its obvious that this is a precensorship film by the innuendo in the script the costumesand the way they touch each other And bikinis before there were bikinis This is no holds barred fun for everyone I dont understand the John Garfield issue though Does it matter whether or not hes in this film If he is he screen is so short that hes basically a prop You need to watch it frame by frame to even find him if hes there Im a big Cagney fan but had never seen this one before I found it on Turner Classics I found it by wonderful accident Sit back and enjoy the ride

0	This movie is horrible It rivals Ishtar in the number of embarrassingly bad moments I would have rated it lower than a 3 save for a couple of funny lines but overall this film was crap It looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere Joe Roth should join Elaine May on the directing sidelines forever

1	Melvyn Douglas once more gives a polished performance in which this time he inhabits the role of a detective who cant place love before duty and adventure and the warmly beautiful Joan Blondell who far from being illiterate as one reviewer suggested wrote a novel about her early life is as enjoyable as ever as his eversuffering sweetheartIts almost a screwball comedy almost a Thin Mantype movie almost a series I guess that didnt quite make it to a sequel It doesnt quite reach classic status but it has all the ingredients for a fun 85 minutes with an episodic but pacey script fine character actors and direction that keeps it all moving fast enough so that you nearly dont notice that Williams Douglas isnt exactly Columbo when it comes to detecting I wish there were more films like this
1	The Unseen is done in a style more like old Hollywood mysteries than a horror show The film is somewhat slow but lots of bizarre imagery keeps it the film alive and watchable The basic idea of young girls stalked by something in the basement is old but good acting and production make the movie worth watching The movie is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects I rated it an 8 out of 10
0	Jane Eyre is one of the greatest novels in the English language and this screenwriter should of read it I hate it when writers use Spark notes for what a novel is all about This movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the bookbr br The whole red room is so down played that I wonder why they even bother to put it in In the book the red room is foreshadowing for the WHOLE story and the rest of Janes life Helen Burns is treated so badly in the movie Im sure she was happy to die and leave early In the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head The whole Christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the moviebr br Do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as Charlotte Bronte masterfully told it
1	What another reviewer called lack of character development I call understatement The movie didnt bash one over the head with overexplanation or unnecessary backstory Yes there were many untold stories that we only got a glimpse of but this was primarily a oneday snapshot into an event that catalyzed change in all of the characters lives Henry Thomass performance was a really lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action Good rental
1	Robert A Heinleins classic novel Starship Troopers has been messed around with in recent years in everything to Paul Verhoevens 1997 film to a TV series to a number of games But none of these so to speak has really captured the spirit of his novel The games are usually unrelated the TV series was more of a spin off and the less said about Verhoevens film the better Little do most know however that in Japan an animated adaptation had already been done released the year of Heinleins death And believe it or not despite its differences this 6part animated series is plotwise the most faithful adaptation of Heinleins classicbr br The most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons something we were deprived of in Verhoevens film Like the book the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel though we see a fair amount of each While events happen differently than in the book the feel of the books plot is present Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement but its only slightly more touched upon than in the book While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book it gets a bit of the anime treatment but what did you expect but its far superior to the film Heinleins political views are merely excised as opposed to the film where they are reversed The big payoff of the series however is the climatic battle on Klendathu between the troopers and the bugsaliens which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film versionbr br Overall I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein And I think they did pretty well with this If you can find this series give it a look
1	This was the beginning of it all Granted this is not Friends at its best but this was the shows pilot lets not forget and not a bad one at that Were introduced to the gang and Central Perk where our story begins Even from this first episode we get a sign of the RossRachel relationship that will come over the next ten years when Ross says I just want to be married again and Rachel storms in with a wedding dress on probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a MonicaJoey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back Something else in this episode Rachel is introduced to Chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes the socalled flashbacks this is contradicted as the two have met on three previous occasions Nevertheless the point is this a fine start to a great show This episode may not be the usual Friends as we are accustomed to them with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was Keep watching first season is a blast
1	This was a wonderful little American propaganda film that is both highly creative AND openly discusses the Nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed While late 1944 and into 1945 would reveal just how evil and horrific they were this film unlike other Hollywood films to date is the most brutally honest film of the era I have seen regarding Nazi atrocitiesbr br The film begins in a courtroom in the futureafter the war is over the film was made in 1944the war ended in May 1945 In this fictitious world court a Nazi leader is being tried for war crimes Wilhelm Grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal Grimms life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks At first it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis However after a while it becomes very apparent that Grimm is just a sadistic monster These episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate dramabr br All in all the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars secondtier actors There are many compelling scenes and performancesespecially the very prescient Jewish extermination scene towards the end that cant help but bring you close to tears It was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some supercreative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first Overall its a mustsee for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good filmbr br FYIThis is not meant as a serious criticism of the film but Hitler was referred to as that paper hanger This is a reference to the myth that Hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper This is in fact NOT truepreviously hed been a starving artist homeless person and served well in the German army in WWI A horrible person yes but never a paper hanger

1	Hatred of a Minute is a hauntingly beautiful film A psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer Eric Seaver Strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a must see for any film student or horror fan The realness of the story and the human side of Eric separate this film from other psycho killer movies Some shout outs to the films producer Bruce Campbell as well as to the film The Evil Dead add some humor for anyone that knows the genre
0	I have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago And I have read it to every one of my 3rd and 5th grade classes over my past 18 years of teaching Supposedly a movie had been made in the past but Id never been able to locate it Well my students and I were all so excited when we heard that Disney had brought Madeline LEngles excellent book to the screen br br As I watched the movie I had the highest of hopes As the film went on I became more and more despondent They had botched it badly Never had I been so let down by a favorite booktofilm adaption I understand that films cant stick strictly to a book but they dont need to change things for the sake of it Most if not all of departures from the book were totally unnecessary br br I kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie Well it wasnt just me Nearly every single one felt the same waycheated out of the great story that Madeline LEngle had so skillfully created br br Why they wondered did Aunt Beast look like Chewbacca from the star wars movie Why couldnt Calvins hair have been red Why did Mrs Which not have the proper witchlike outfit that was such a clever play on her name Basically we all wonderedwhy did nearly every single detail have to be changed br br I have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make I am still waiting for that movie This one was A Wrinkle in Time in only the broadest of senses Im going to write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take on the task
1	Sure Titanic was a good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change The first time you see the movie you see the underlying lovestory and think ooh how romantic The second time and I am not the only one to think this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking When is this dn ship going to sink And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times The acting in this film is not bad but definetly not great either Was I glad DiCaprio did not win an oscar for that film I mean who does he think he is Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington He does 1 halfgood movie and wont do a film for less than 20 million And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it But enough about in my eyes the worst character of the film Kate Winslets performance on the other hand was wonderful I also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together There is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many lovestories as it is filmmakers shouldnt try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie Out of a possible 100 I give this film a mere 71
1	This typical Mamet film delivers a quiet evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man Joe Mantegna good Explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist Lindsay Crouse it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences The cast includes a number of the players found is several of Mamets films Steven Goldstein Jack Wallace Ricky Jay Andy Potok Allen Soule William H Macy and they do their usual good job I loved Lindsay Crouse in this film and have often wondered why she didnt become a more noted player than she has become Perhaps Im not looking in the right placesbr br The movie proceeds at a slow pace with flat dialog yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bangup ending Youd expect a real let down at the ending but I found it uplifting and satisfying I love this movie
0	This is the official sequel to the 92 scifi action thriller In the original Van Damme was among several dead Vietnam War vets revived to be the perfect soldiers Unisols In this one its I guess about a dozen years later since Van Damme has a daughter about that age Now hes working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest Unisols codenamed Unisol 2500 for some reason As usual something goes wrong the onsite supercomputer named Seth like the snake in King Cobra the same year goes powercrazy takes command of the Unisols and even downloads its computer brain into a new superUnisol body Jai White Were lookin at the next step in evolution folks Most of Van Dammes fights are with one particularly mean Unisol pro wrestler Goldberg who just keeps on comin drop him off a building no good run him down with a truck no go Shoot him burn him forgetaboutit Much of the humor is traced to how Van Damme is now outmoded and outclassedhes even going grey around the edges But though he takes a lickin he keeps on kickin Most sequels of this sort are pretty lame pale imitations of the originals and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius it manages to be consistently entertaining especially if youre a prowrestling fan
0	The fourth Tremors feature goes back in time to the year 1889 The Legend Begins in the small city of Perfection which was then Rejection Nevada As the story begins seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly Graboids Some of the characters in the presentday Tremors films have ancestors both figurative and literal in the past Most obvious is the everreturning Michael Gross as Hiram Gummer Unlike his descendant Mr Gross is inept with firearms so he hires gunslinger Billy Drago as Black Hand Kelly to shoot em up some Dirt Dragonsbr br This one takes some getting used to as it takes place in the distant past Its like a western with miniature versions of the original films monster Graboids These tamer Dirt Dragons are nowhere near as terrorizing as their Tremors 1990 counterparts Consequently in this film the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground which would not have happened in the original movie And it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly when Gross temporarily decides to leave town Why so helpless Why didnt Brent Roam as Juan Pedilla immediately rally the people to fight without Gross Disappointingbr br Tremors 4 The Legend Begins 2004 SS Wilson Michael Gross Brent Roam Billy Drago

1	I saw this movie when I was a child It blew me away This was before the days of television so a movie of this magnitude could send a young kid into orbit It so impressed me that I went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days The special effects used at this time were far ahead of its time Sabu was a real delight as was Rex Ingram as the Genie I found myself singing I want to be a sailor for months after the film left town I would recommend this movie to any and everyone I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt who was as villainous a character as youd ever want to meet Also June Duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture The color was outstanding Give this movie an AAA

0	OK I saw this movie to get a benchmark for bad but with this movie its Unisols best movie now plot Luc Devereux is now a technical expert who is working with the government with his partner Maggie whos been through countless hours of training and combat with him to refine and perfect the UniSol program in an effort to make a new stronger breed of soldier that is more sophisticated intelligent and agile All of the new Unisols which are faster and stronger than their predecessors are connected through an artificially intelligent computer system called SETH a SelfEvolving Thought Helix When SETH discovers that the Universal Soldier program is scheduled to be shut down because of budget cuts he takes matters into his own hands to protect himself Killing those who try to shut off his power and unleashing his platoon of supersoldiers led by the musclebound Romeo SETH spares Deveraux only because Deveraux has the secret code that is needed to deactivate a builtin program that will shut SETH down in a matter of hours With the help of a hacker named Squid SETH takes human form Not only must Luc contend with ambitious reporter Erin who wont leave his side but Luc also must contend with General Radford who wants to take extreme measures to stop SETH SETH has also kidnapped Lucs injured 13yearold daughter Hillary and is now holding her hostage Luc is the only person who can rescue Hillary because Luc knows firsthand how a UniSol thinks feels and fights now there are problems like in any movie like did anyone find it weird how a reporter justsohappened to be there and The soldiers can take being flattened with a truck however when Vanne Damme shoots them with a gun with one bullet and they die and the final fight scene was unbelievable when Luc is now human and Seth is 5x stronger and faster than any other Unisol and Luc can take a hit from him with the final fight when Luc smashes him to pieces I was really surprised that the pieces didnt melt and reform him Terminator 2 another thing that bugs me is how the hell does Vanne Damme get good actors to play relatives I mean in the case of Vanne Damme its completely off the grid of how Science Fiction this movie is The Music Score now that must have a mention have you ever listened to a song where youd rather cut a blackboard with a knife well Universal Soldier 2 is like that The good points are theres no Dolph HOORAY and unlike the 1st one there is only one naked scene whereas in the 1st one there are many Im still haunted by the scenes in 1 also the actors in this have some talent whereas in the first one the casting guys were sadists if you dont believe me look it up

0	I expected alot from this movie Kinda like Lee as a Naustradamous like caracter but instead all I got was a waste of time and a boring movie I cant even explain this movie It had wooden acting terrible script from pieces from the Bible like hurricanes tidal waves and earthquakes But that was at the end The rest of it I had to wait and hope that something meaningfull would happen but it didnt This movie is about a couple that tries to find out the changes going on in the world like places in China where there was an earthquake and end up at a convent run by eight nuns and a priest The convent end up being the key to the misshappenings The whole movie is missleading and boring One of Lees worst

0	It has been said a city on hill cannot hide itself and Virginia City Nevada perched on the side of Mt Davidson at 6200 ft west of Tahoe is a prime example or in the context of the movie should be Virginia City exploded in the American dream as a shower of gold and silver suspiciously the same year the Civil War began It was the birthplace of the dean of American letters it was where a young reporter named Samuel Clemens began using the name Mark Twain and went on to become Americas most famous writer It was also the birthplace of the great Hearst fortune and the launching pad of John Mackay who became the wealthiest man in America the third wealthiest man in the world Hey they should have made the movie about him In the 1860s Virginia CIty was THE boomtown of all boomtowns the home of the big bonanza at one time the largest metropolitan area west of St Louis and East of San Francisco But Virginia City the movie misses all that and is more about a hogwash NorthSouth duello between the characters played by Errol Flynn and Randolph Scott Flynn is Capt Kerry Bradford a Union officer who is a POW in a concentration camp run by a mean Confederate commander named Capt Vance Irby played by Scott These two are always getting in each others way Bradford escapes and then tries to stop a shipment of gold bullion being snuck out of VC by who else other than Irby Hey whats he doing here Horrible Bogart plays a laughable Mexican bandit who cant decide whos side hes on Miriam Hopkins plays a murky character named Julia Hayne obviously a historical lunge at the towns first lady Julia Bulette who in real life a celebrated prostitute She goes to Washington and talks Honest Abe about saving BRADFORD not Irby from hanging and blah blah blah Go figure They shoulda hung the writer In real life Twain reports that on the last day of the War the setting sun caused the American flag atop Mt Davidson to appear to the puzzled residents to be weirdly on fire kind of like the movie Three days later they discovered that on that day the South capitulated One interesting quirk in the film is how sidekicks Alan Hale and Guin Williams flick their pistols forward when they shoot like theyre fishing or trying to make the bullets go faster Not a bad idea for the movie The same kind of goofiness is lathered over sap and corn throughout the movie Gosh how could they miss the gold madness profligate wealth gun battles in the silver mines Mark Twain getting run out of town and beat up after a showdown the crooked railroad the Opera House fire Artemis Ward Bulettes huge funeral the Chinese tongs the black saloons the Auction All this high on a mountain surrounded by desert The truth was unreal Did its fabulous wealth actually spark the great American holocaust Well if you count this movie it wouldnt be the first debacle to come out of Virginia City Its a disappointment for Virginia City fans because it misses what made the town a city of illusions where it is said evil seeps out of the ground Okay other than that its a fun movie Flynn and the gang are always great no matter what history theyre destroying If Flynn would just play his rotten self Id double my rating
1	I remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared back in 1993 I was 8 at the time and now at the age of 22 it feels weird to have seen this cult show start and end and to look back on itThe 90s all of a sudden seem so far away what a great decade Anyway I used to watch MonsterVision all the time as I am a huge fan of monster flicks and horror films It was like the 90s version of Chiller Theater If MST3K can get DVDs why not Joe Bobs show at least MonsterVision was more interesting and informative A lot of Joe Bobs comments and info on the films were just hilarious Most of the movies shown on the show were B or C grade but it showed a lot of A house films as well like the Hammer films from England which are Top notch as well as many with the stop motion majesty of Ray Harryhausen Many were oddball flicks that you wouldnt see anywhere else like the the Japanese SciFi movies besides of course Godzilla which is familiar to almost everyone and independent movies like Metal Storm and Motel Hell With the new Decade of film preservation and more independent minded directors I think MonsterVision would be a good show for IFC to pick up since they already have a hit with the IFC grind house show Im sure this show will be picked up again for nostalgia reasons some day I guess will have to wait and see Until then thats Great Television
1	This isnt exactly a great film but I admire the writers and director for trying something a little different The films main theme is fate and small seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future In some ways this reminds me of the film SLIDING DOORS though instead of focusing on one random event seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion Plus an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scenelike hes some sort of omnipotent being but theres absolutely no explanation of him in the film like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in THE HUDSUCKER PROXYbr br The DVD jacket shows just Audrey Tautou This is capitalize on her success in AMELIE though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role The pace is brisk the acting fine and the conclusion isnt bad at all The only reason I didnt score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and I think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots
1	I loved this movie since I was 7 and I saw it on the opening day It was so touching and beautiful I strongly recommend seeing for all Its a movie to watch with your family by farbr br My MPAA rating PG13 for thematic elements prolonged scenes of disastor nuditysexuality and some language
0	A good deal of running around A badly conceived adversary with very little complexity A scientist who works in communications sending off signals into space and receiving them gets caught up with aliens Along with his pretty wife he invades their territory and is given secrets about them He becomes rather traitorous in the process Granted he is given little choice anyway There is a scene where he gives them everything they want This is a dull movie with lots of long stretches where little happens The plot isnt technically bad Its just that we are usually following a car a trip through a woods investigating a building This is what editing is all about I suppose the story wouldnt technically support much more Not much here

1	I watched the trailer on the DVD after seeing the film and I think anyone who saw it before watching the film would be very surprised and possibly disappointed It made much of the fact that the film was by the director of Cube and made it look like a horror film when in fact it is an Absurdist comedy IMDBs spell checker doesnt seem to think that Absurdist is a word but it is reminiscent of Rosencrantz and Guildernstern are Deadbr br I love the way the story builds up slowly at first then gradually escalates I also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film That and the fact that the story plays out mainly in just the one set are the only respects in which this film is similar to Cube I recommend it

1	Its true that Danny Steinmanns The Unseen is a simplistic horror thriller with a very predictable plot no particular attempts for twists or surprises whatsoever and featuring literally every single cliché the genre has brought forward over the decades but that doesnt necessarily make it a bad film On the contrary my friends and I were pleasantly surprised by this obscure but nevertheless intense little 80s shock feature that mainly benefices from a handful of brutal images and a downright brilliant casting The beautiful and ambitious reporter Jennifer Fast and two of her equally attractive friends travel to a little Californian town to shoot a documentary on the anniversary festival but their hotel forgot to register their booking In their search for a place to stay the trio runs into the exaggeratedly friendly but suspicious museum curator Ernest Keller who invites the girls to stay at his remote countryside mansion One by one the girls experience that Keller and his extremely introvert and submissive sister Victoria hide a dark and murderous secret inside their house The Unseen can easily be described as a cheap and ultimately perverse amalgamation of the horror classics Psycho and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The plot is a series of familiar themes that became notorious and endlessly imitated due to these two films like twisted family secrets in the cellar voyeurism crazed inbred killers and a very unappetizing treatment of chickens Still I dont consider these to be negative remarks as The Unseen is a completely unpretentious and modestly unsettling thriller that clearly never intended to be the greatest horror classic of the decade Although the denouement of the plot is pretty clear quite fast director Steinmann attempts to maintain the mystery by keeping the evil present in the house unseen like the title promised The casting choices and acting performances are truly what lift this sleeper above the level of mediocre Sydney Lassick immortalized since his role as the overly anxious psychiatric patient Charley Cheswick in One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest is truly the ideal choice for the role of Ernest Keller His persistent friendliness and almost naturally perverted appearance are exactly what the character needed Also Stephen Furst who eventually turns from the unseen into the seen gives away a tremendous performance as Junior He looks and acts like an authentic handicapped man and his attempts to get close to Jennifer in the basement are genuinely unnerving The Unseen is a slow and predictable but nevertheless potent early 80s film that will certainly appeal to fans of 70s exploitation and generally weird stuff
1	I would highly recommend this movie And I certainly shall be personally recommending it to my friends and family here and abroad It was with excited anticipation that I have just preordered it online I enjoyed it so much It is not out until FebruaryMarch 2008 but it will be well worth the wait But first go and see it in the cinema if you can There is nothing quite like the CinemaExperience of a cinemamade movie Insist that your local cinema puts it on I went to see Seachd the Inaccessible Pinacle tonight down here in London and was really impressed It is a marvel a truly beautiful film set in the Scottish Highlands you will laugh you will cry you will be moved in may different ways you will be intrigued and as the story within the stories is revealed you will be amazed at that revelationbr br This movie is in Scottish Gaelic with English Subtitles but do not let that detract you if you are not a speaker of the Gaelic I am just starting and my son does not nor did many people there tonight and it did not spoil it for us by any manner of means Superlatives do not suffice The photography is superb there is no CGI here and the movie is all the better for that here you have true photography The script is so skilfully and subtly written The manylayered plot weaves the magic art of the ancient storytellers The music is at times rousing at times haunting but always adding to the atmospheric ambiance And the acting it is to behold and the actors they the true weavers of this delightful yet profound film particularly the two main actors Padruigtheyoung and Padruigtheelder A true bard if ever there was who both carried a very heavy load And the Direction Well watch out Richard And the Producer responsible for raising funding hiring key personnel and arranging for distributors A task well done I hope that you will make sure that distribution goes out to our communities abroad And the Gaelic community Uill without you it could not have happened We were told that this movie was made on a low budget but you would not know it and I think it might well be because for what they might have lacked in money they more than made up for with the richness of the heart and the warmth and cooperation of the local Scottish Gaelic communitybr br A heartfelt thanks to all concerned in the making and the sponsoring of Seachd Mòran taing Many thanks From the Gaels to the World From the World to the Gaels
0	This is really really bad Lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job But what makes it worth watching is the scene where OJ angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric I got the evidence on you Makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren but i couldnt find it on iTunes Talk about seeing into the futureToo funny for words The rest of the movie is forgettable The score and songs are more interesting than the script Ditto the sequel Which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all My understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these B movies Doesnt say much for the worlds viewing habits
0	Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow was one of the many 50s movies about hotrodding teens encountering the supernatural In this case the teens cant pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted With nowhere else to go they decide on an apparently haunted house As you may have guessed once they arrive some weird things start happening And theres a twist at the endbr br Theres nothing in this movie that you havent seen in other movies but its nice entertainment nonetheless My favorite character was the foulmouthed parrot Well let me rephrase that he didnt talk like a character in a Quentin Tarantino movie but he said things that we dont expect out of a bird The movies pure hokum but harmless
1	Europa or as it is also known Zentropa is one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen The blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless a true feast for the eyes The picture was a contender for a 1991s Golden Palm in Canners The award went to Barton Fink by Coen brothers a film stylistically very similar to Zentropa Heres an exercise in class rent both films and be a judge for yourself
0	A typical Lanza flick that had limited audience appeal with a weak story line that was put together simply to justify Lanzas MGM contract at the timebr br As reported by member Lastliberal above Grayson could not stand Lanza because of his obscene advances towards her off and sometimes on camera In addition his gutter mannerism and the continual smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were intolerable After doing their second and last film together Toast of New Orleans the normally quiet Grayson stormed into Louie B Mayers office and told him in no uncertain words that she would never work with Lanza again  period Mayer felt that Grayson was much more valuable to MGM then Lanza so Graysons statement stuck Grayson went on to star in a number of widely received and far more profitable musicals with Howard Keel and others Later in life when asked to compare Lanza and Keel her reply was that there was no comparison between them and that Keel was great to work with and had much more appeal to the real people in the audiences
1	I have to say from the beginning when i watched the Stargate movie movie i wasnt blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie with a lot of POTENTIAL though the movie wasnt as erm amazing as other sci fi movies such as Star wars or aliens which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing even though im not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people i dont remember one line from either of those movies im not a big fan of wearing star wars T shirts in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you ah getting slightly off the point here well my point is that the that you dont have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end in 2006br br though i didnt like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in 1997 and let me tell you the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today I have to admit that I would never have gone into Sci fi if it wasnt for stargate and my dad who actually got me into sci fi when i was like 6 and im glad he did other wise i wouldnt have seen the brilliant shows like SG1 which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies basically if a new sci fi series isnt better or as good as SG1 its not worth watching basically this is the best sci fi show to date and if you dont watch this then you have no idea what you are missing
0	Film starts in 1840 Japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide Its a very gory bloody sequence Then it jumps to present daywell 1982 to be precise Ted Edward Albert wife Laura Susan George and their annoying little kid move to Japan for hubbys work They rent a house andsurprise surpriseit just happens to be the house where the murders took place The three dead people are around as ghosts the makeup is hysterically bad and make life hell for the familybr br Sounds OKbut its really hopeless Theres a bloody opening and ending and NOTHING happens in between There is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious They look so fakeI swear I saw the strings pulling one alongand theyre muttering Theres a pointless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes probably just to show off Georges body another one about 40 minutes later but that was necessary to the plot and a really silly exorcism towards the end The fight scene between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen to be believedbr br As for actingAlbert was OK as the husband and McClure was pretty good as a family friend But Georgeas alwaysis terrific in a lousy film She gives this film a much needed liftbut cant save it Im giving this a 2 just for her and the gory opening and closing That aside this is a very boring film
0	A cowboy sympathetic to the plight of a nearby Indian tribe is wrongly accused in the rape and murder of the chiefs daughter leading to much hate and violencebr br This crackpot nudie feature is fun to look at though thoroughly impossible to defend on any artistic level The terrible costumes and the fact that all the Indians are obviously white makes this look more like a live action cartoon than the serious production that its press materials pretends it to bebr br In short the plentiful nudity the real reason for watching this is good Everything else is not Theres definitely better examples of both genresbr br More interesting is that The Ramrodder was filmed at the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and features not one but two members of the Manson family Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil who was probably already in the can for murder at the time this hit the sodastained screens of the Pussycat Theater
1	This movie is the best film ever I cant remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me with a tear in my eye I admire this movie It has all the elements that a good movie must have Excellent Dialogues Music Acting StoryPlot A story of friendship courage kindliness and loyalty between a Street performing who famous to The King of Masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar Little girl liked to be his granddaughter and King of Masks liked a grandson They were not conventional in real Every scene they were together was priceless The camera work is flawless and grips you The acting is inspired Xu Zhu was Excellent as The King of Masks Renying Zhou Doggie looks pretty and played her character very well Zhigang Zhao as Liang Sao Lang was great He played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well If you havet this movie try it once Do watch it
0	If you like to comment on films where the script arrive halfway the movie then this is the one A setting and acting as in a Porn movie but nothing is happening only some groping and touching of the third kind Which actually becomes very boring after 45 minutes of touchy feely but no action A few of the actors Ive seen in real x rated movies and there their acting then was a lot better All the special effects are done by the great Rondo Whom performs all the magic whit his mind A cult movie is written on the box Does that mean that this film is not to be watched at allbr br Get drunk with some friends and watch this movie on new years eve ore thanks giving
1	As long as you go into this movie knowing that its terrible bad acting bad effects bad story bad everything then youll love it This is one of my favorite goof on movies watch it as a comedy and have a dozen good laughs
1	With a well thought out cast this movie was a great comedic relief The plot is wellwritten and the cast was knockout Every bit as good as the reviews suggested a rarity and was highly entertaining Being a huge John Candy fan myself this movie was no disappointment
0	I have to admit that I stuck this one out thinking something would have to happen besides the dead body in the first scenes and her disposal of him I was wrong It was a cinema verite of Betty hits the Beach encased for the first part by Mordant Morven I really dont care what young lassies from Scotland do these days who thy screw what drugs they take Visually the stroll through the Cabo de Gata in Andalucia was pleasant and surely the high point for me The nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend As the movie came to a close I had two thoughts 1 Thats all there is 2 Now I see why her boyfriend killed himself Rename it Bare Bitch Boredom or What I did on my trip to Spain Im such a sucker for sticking these things out
1	I like it because of my recent personal experience Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite The characters in the firm did not really enjoy their real lives but they did enjoy themselves ie what they were The movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory A good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life Many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those Before Sunrise dealt with it in a nice way which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head It just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities This made the conversations between the characters interesting not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas You would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story The end was not quite important after all You could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie Movies are supposed to be enjoyable This is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it I am on a journey too The movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions
0	On the surface this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation that is how to become a true self by embracing the socalled dark side of human nature Thus we have the Darkling a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company that is recognition of men and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled more or less successfully br br However if we dig a little deeper we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person in the opening scene the main character male car mechanic fallen from graceis collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl Lesson 1 Cars are persons embodied with immortal souls and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery The wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished just after that another character Rubin buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a oncelostnowfound famous racecar and is warned by the salesman Lesson 2 Just like any other person a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced In addition there is the twist that Rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of Rubins own personal greed for more profit Lesson 3 Thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only but always as an end in itself then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to Rubin and more importantly Rubins car The main characters assessment of the cars qualities is not just based on its outer appearance but also by a thorough look inside the engine room Lesson 4 A car is not just to be judged by its looks it is what is inside that really counts There is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell Rubin a fake collectors car This scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson 3 br br There are numerous other examples in the movie of the carpersontheme and I am too tired now to bother citing all of them but the point remains and I guess this is what Im really trying to say that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do or if youre a car devotee
0	This movie is a disgrace to the Major League Franchise I live in Minnesota and even I cant believe they dumped Cleveland Yes I realize at the time the real Indians were pretty good and the Twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the American League but still be consistent Anyway I loved the first Major League liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the Indians would finally go all the way to the series You cant tell me this wasnt the plan after the second film was completed What Happened Anyways if your a true fan of the original Major League do yourself a favor and dont watch this junk
1	Henry Thomas was great His character held my attention I was so into the story that I forgot it wasnt real I wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was The other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character The way they banded together to help one another was truly awe inspiring I love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit you over the head in that you are not smart enough to figure things out for yourself
1	Johny To makes here one of his best style exercises making a strong film with a good Yakuzas story The election of the new Yakuzas boss is the beginning of a war inside the organizationbr br In my opinion the violence is wise used in the context making a very strong gangs film I specially love the way he tells the history moving around all the roles inside the Yakuzas family and making that we see the violence like the only way they have to solve their problemsbr br Talking about the technical aspects the film is a good example of paused rythmic and planified way of shooting a film One of the Hong Kong Films of the year Is like Infernal affairs but without the easy actionviolence scenes and the confused storyline Strongly recommended to all Asian films loversbr br sorry for my English better do in Spanish lol
1	I liked the film Some of the action scenes were very interesting tense and well done I especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it A very tense action scene that seemed well donebr br Some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography unusual colors or interesting angles Also the film is funny is several parts I also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too Id give the film an 8 out of 10
1	This is an OK adaptation but not as good as the TV version The actors are generally alright but I found Jeremy Northam rather wet as Mr Knightley particularly compared to Mark Strong in the TV version Gwyneth Paltrow is OK and her English accent is pretty good but again I preferred Kate Beckinsales Emma There are excellent support performances from Toni Collette Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompsonbr br The script is often played too much for laughs the book is a comedy but there are too many setpiece gags here and also the Frank Churchill subplot is almost completely absentbr br My biggest criticism is the scenery It is far too lush England has never been like this It looks like a chocolate box Only Americans would make it like thisbr br Despite these criticisms I enjoyed this film but would recommend the TV adaptation more
0	This film is absolutely horrific One of the worst movies Ive ever seen The story does nearly not exist the characters are full of stereotypes and the SpecialFX only make you laugh The only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the Rapper Coolio as some kind of police officerbr br If this film was supposed to be a comedy I didnt quite get the point If you want to watch this movie please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughsespecially when the first SpecialFX appear on the screenbr br But if you like trash movies made on the cheap this film is a mustsee for you
0	This version moved a little slow for my taste and I suppose I have problems with this play to begin with But first the movie its a typical TV movie version of a play which means it doesnt have the flair of the original film version with William Holden What they couldnt afford to hire more than twelve people as extras Why move the movie up to 1966 So you could give the little sister a line about the Vietnam war protests Why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movementbr br As for the casting some hits some misses Jay O Sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with Josh Brolin Brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes Hes believable as an exBMOC jock but he doesnt have the raw sensuality of William Holden I always thought Brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him pardon the pun Gretchen Moll was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played She didnt project the innocence or ignorance that the character required Maybe its because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be But then again Holden was ten years too old Bonnie Bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and Mary Steenburgen cant seem to make up her mind whether she was playing Blanche duBois or Katharine from The Taming of The Shrewbr br As for Mr Inges play I always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue The Twilight Zone I believe offer a likely epilogue with the episode Spur of the Moment where a young Diana Hyland was being chased by a bitter older Diana Hyland because the younger Diana Hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to Hal Carter
0	You have to figure that when the stars name is listed wrong in the opening credits you are not in for a good time the credit reads Cuba Gooding JR Some nice car chase shoot em up blow em up action if ALL you want is action because the relationship to what plot exists is tenuous at best and completely unbelievable The motivations of the characters especially that of Goodings at the end are worse then unbelievable they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled All I can think is that Andy Cheng must be a really nice guy to get this many good actors into this foul a project he cant have something on all of them can he
1	Probably the finest fantasy film ever made Sumptuous colour spectacular sets incredible spoton Miklos Rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood Acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands but here the poetic dialog is deftly sensitively spoken the humour is subtle and delightful as wellbr br Doubtless Spielberg and Lucas were enthralled by this one Along with The Four Feathers 1939 one of the two finest motion pictures released by Alexander Korda and London Filmsand one of the finest motion pictures ever madebr br A true compelling classic
0	I saw this film at its premier at Sundance 09br br Since American Beauty is a movie that had something to say I had hopes for Towelhead Unfortunately it was a disappointment In fact of countless movies Ive seen in almost a dozen Sundance festivals Towelhead is the only Sundance movie Ive ever wanted to walk out early frombr br The worst problem with Towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of provocative concepts concerning cultural stereotypes rather than with an organic human drama The screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by Alicia Erian The famous Edith Wharton quote comes to mind I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the authors political views That observation is especially devastating for Towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic If there ever was a time when Towelheads white male villains condescending portrayals of blacks ironic treatments of foreign cultures etc were fresh its long pastbr br For a more detailed review please look up any of the many professional reviews available online Almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based onbr br On the other hand the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled As you read through the reviews in this and similar sites youll frequently come across superlatives stunning breathtaking profound shocking It embarrasses me to read them but it does not surprise me Indeed Ive encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial cultural gender or sexual issues as deeply moving thought provoking full of profound insight If you are such a person by all means rent Towelhead and be moved by it On the other hand if you set your standards higher you can safely pass on this one

1	The movie is truly poignant unique and uplifting The story is universal in that its a battle between good evil and the world between THE MOST IMPORTANT thing is that its rating is wrong misleading and a travesty Blockbuster has it rated as though it were an X rated movie The truth is is that it is closer to G than PG and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple subtitles
0	I should never have started this film and stopped watching after 34s I missed the really botched ending This film was a disappointment because it could have been so much better It had nice atmosphere a top notch cast and director good locations But a baaaaaad story line a bad script I paid attention to Kenneth Branaghs southern accentit was better than the script The plot was stupiddriven by characters acting in unreal and improbable ways No one behaves like this outside of Hollywood scripts
0	I just rented and watched this movie just to see whats all the fuss about So heres what my reactions to it are Its easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors The main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists This concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film However the movie doesnt shock or disturb me at all It just bored me This movie could be easily shortened to under 45 minutes All lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time like those scenery scenes and some scenes I described belowbr br Contains spoiler I find the rape scenes quite tame I dont know if I have watched the cut or uncut version if there is actually such a version I also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot Heres a list on top of my mindbr br Why dont the rapists rape Jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are That would be an excellent timebr br Why dont they just gang rape her instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening Jennifers ordeal by such a long time It would probably be more shocking and disturbing that waybr br I found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house Maybe to show that these rapists are really imbecilesbr br These rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right they shouldnt send a coward imbecile to do the jobbr br Why didnt Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left Which should be the first thing that pops up in most peoples mind especially for someone who is a writer br br Why didnt these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw Jennifer is alivebr br I find it really amazing that a slender lady like Camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him Ends spoilerbr br But hey this movie is not without its merits Camille Keaton is gorgeous and I get to hear one of the funniest line I have recently heard when Matthew protest of going back into the house and kills Jennifer Why me Why Me I didnt even cm
1	Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are comedies about washup RR groups Actually here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much better written and acted out whereas Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison Still Crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie People who expect Spinal Taplike attempt on satire would be disappointed by the lighthearted nature of the movie but Id take a successful selfironic romp of Still Crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is Spinal Tap
1	I would reccomend this film to everyone Not only to the fans of the rocker Luciano Ligabue but to all filmbuffs Because its sincere moving funny and true Because Ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover and every frame of his film is made with love and care Because his characters are loved and ask to be loved Because most of the Italian debut films are lousy and this one done by an outsider is a real joy to watch and to listen at Because Stefano Accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza who was like Freccia beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin that Ligabue shows as it is unglamorous and ugly without indulging in easy moralisms Because its a film that speaks to our heart our ears our souls And because I lived the experience of the FM radios and it was exactly like that Thanks Luciano

1	A small funny film It is totally incredible unbelievable impossible But it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his phantasms Of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals you can get to on the Internet You must not believe ten percent of what youre told there and never ever ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally Most of their businesses there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you But here the chap deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive he is absurdly silly But then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his victimizer and winning One think is sure too Security in English airports is not exactly what it should be but I guess its not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and regulations it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them systematically Then they have their vengeance by losing your luggage a real plague on modern airports and dont expect to get fair compensation Or even confiscating a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous I can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener Funny isnt it Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines

0	MST 3000 should do this movie It is the worst acted movie I have ever seen First of all you find out that the shooter has no bank account and no history since leaving the army in 1993 and pays his rent in cash There is no way in hell that a person like that would ever be allowed to be that close to a president not to mention a high profile job Also the head of security for the POTHUS would not be so emotional that he would start drinking into a haze if the president was shot This movie sucked I cannot express the extremite that this movie was Every single actor was terrible Even the chick at the trailer park I crap on this garbage What a waste of time
1	REnted this one accidentally it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting didnt find out until i got home watched it anyways Absolutely FANTASTIC a wonderful movie and one of my top three favorite of all time i recommend it to Everyonebr br The story is enjoyable and easy to follow this could have been easily messed up but the actors and director do a great job of keeping it togetherbr br The actors themselves are fantastic displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job br br Gotta find a copy somewhere
0	It SURPRISINGLY had a plot Ive seen movies with less plot I dont wanna mention Asian movies but I thought the camera wasnt bad at all for a cheap movie like this and also the atmosphere wasnt too bad There is no real reason for most things people do and the way they react to what happens Although I do think that about a lot of movies in this case it was horrible of coursebr br It ripped off some movies SO badly just for single scenes The acting was bad but Ive seen worse The movie was bad but Ive seen worse Watching this film is an experience between boredom laughing fits death wish sadism horniness and entertainment on a low levelbr br So if you like gory movies with stupid plots this one is the right film for youbr br I gave it 310 because it CAN be entertaining if you dont expect to see a good movie and youre in the right mood
1	Made after QUARTET was TRIO continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by Maugham Here the three stories are THE VERGER MR KNOWITALL and SANITORIUM The first two are comic THE VERGER is like a prolonged joke but one with a good payoff and the last more serious as health issues are involved Again the author introduces the film and the storiesbr br James Hayter soon to have his signature role as Samuel Pickwick is the hero in THE VERGER He holds this small custodialtype job in a church but the new Vicar Michael Hordern is an intellectual snob When he hears Hayter has no schooling he fires him Hayter has saved some money so he tells his wife Kathleen Harrison he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop He has a good eye and his store thrives Soon he has a whole chain of stores When his grandchild is christened by Hordern the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his exVerger The payoff is when bank manager Felix Aylmer meets with Hayter about diversifying his investments Ill leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meetingbr br According to Maugham he met a man like Max Kelada Nigel Patrick on a cruise In MR KNOWITALL Kelada is a splashy friendly and slightly overbearing type from the Middle East who is on a business trip regarding jewelry by steamship His stateroom mate is Mr Grey the ever quiet and proper Wilfred HydeWhite who is somewhat silently disapproving of Max Max likes to enliven things and soon is heavily involved in the ships entertainment At this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the nonMaugham story and film CHINA SEAS 1935 as Max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real I wont describe the way Max rises to the occasionbr br SANITORIUM is the longest segment Roland Culver plays Ashenden the fictional alterego of Maugham a writer and one time spy as in Hitchcocks THE SECRET AGENT Here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health He finds a remarkable crew of people including Jean Simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman Finlay Currie as an irascible Scotsman John Laurie as a second irascible Scotsman who is at war with Currie Raymond Huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up and Michael Rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness Culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions The last dealing with Simmons and Rennie is ironic but deeply movingbr br It was a dandy followup to the earlier QUARTET and well worth watching

0	I enjoyed the first reviewers comment far more than I did the film when I saw it at a secondrun theatre in the early 80s I was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the Tenniel drawings But to me the cast was largely squandered their personalities muffled by the masks while the direction I think of as being unusually static and the photography murky The rating jotted down at the time was a nought which means not worth sitting through even oncebr br Still I too would jump at a chance to have a second look

1	House of Games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels It is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller It is blessed with marvelous performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna and a strong strong cast of supporting players and it introduces Ricky Jay card sharp extraordinaire prestidigitator and historian of magic Its dialogue written by David Mamet is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie in which reality is often in question an extra dimension of unrealnessbr br On the face of it House of Games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con men diametrically different from The Sting which was played merely for glamour and yuks At this level it does succeed admirablybr br However you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization The only movie I know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated Private Benjamin That thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of Goldie Hawn to chase after some easy laughs House of Games sticks to its business As Poe once said of a good short story it drives relentlessly to its conclusionbr br There is another strain of moviesaboutwomen epitomized by Thelma and Louise a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed whether or not they realize their inner strengths What tripebr br As usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater It should be a natural for film festivals Nominate it for one near you if you get the chancebr br I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23 year old daughter Better she should see it on a TV than not at all
1	Still Crazy is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of alltime It has been erroneously compared to This Is Spinal Tap which it has no relation to Spinal Tap is a satire and quite frankly not a very good one in spite of its outing of many rock clichés Unlike Tap Still Crazy is populated by great actors great songs and great human situations You CARE about the people in Still Crazy Thats all that matters Oh yeah the musics pretty damn good too written by Mick Jones of Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze American audiences were already familiar with Stephen Rea The Crying Game but would only later become familiar with Bill Nighy Underworld Love Actually Pirates Of The Caribbean II and Timothy Spall the Harry Potter movies
1	Get this film if at all possible You will find a really good performance by Barbara Bach beautiful cinematography of a stately and incredibly clean but creepy old house and an unexpected virtuoso performance by The Unseen I picked up a used copy of this film because I was interested in seeing more of Bach whom Id just viewed in The Spy Who Loved Me I love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little So we start with a nice fresh premise TV reporter Bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a California town Solvang that celebrates its Swedish ancestry by putting on a big folk festival She brings along a camerawoman who happens to be her sister and another associate The late Karen Lamm plays Bachs sister and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to it is just too funny watching Bach Mrs Ringo Starr and Lamm Mrs Dennis Wilson going down the street having a sisterly quarrel Anyway Bachs disgruntled beau follows her to Solvang as hes not done arguing with her Theres a lot of feeling still between them but she doesnt wanna watch him tear himself up anymore about his downthedrain football career The ladies arrive in Solvang to do the assignment for their station only to find their reservations were given away to someone else Maybe to Bachs boyfriend because think of it  wheres he gonna stay The gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go Mistakenly trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum they catch the interest of proprietor Mr Keller the late Sidney Lassick who decides to be a gentleman and lodge them at his home insisting his wife will be happy to receive them Oh no Next thing we know Keller is making a whispered phone call to his wife warning her that companys coming and threatening that shed better play along Trouble in paradise The ladies are eager to settle in and get back to Solvang to shoot footage and interview Swedes but one of the girls doesnt feel good Bach and Lamm leave her behind wondering to themselves about Mrs Keller played heartbreakingly by pretty Lelia Goldoni who looks like she just lost her best pal Speaking of which undertheweather Vicki slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot tub not realizing that Keller has crept into her room to inspect the keyhole She hears him thinks hes come to deliver linen and calls out her thanks Lassick did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old peeping tom who didnt get a long enough look After hes left poor Vicki tumbles into bed for a nap but gets yanked out of it real fast in a really decent frightening round of action by something BIG that has apparently crept up through a grille on the floor The Unseen Lamm comes home next Bach is out finishing an argument with her beau and cant find anyone in the house She knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen and on hands and knees to collect it her hair and fashionable scarf sway temptingly over the black floor grille attracting The Unseen again Well at about the time poor Lamm is getting her quietus in the kitchen we do a flashback into Mr Kellers past and get the full story of what his sick sadistic background really is and why his wife doesnt smile much Bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are Meanwhile Lassick has been apprised of the afternoons carnage by his weeping wife and decides he cant let Bach off the premises to reveal the secret of his home He tempts her down into the basement where the last act of the Keller family tragedy finally opens to all of usbr br I cannot say enough for Stephen Furst whom Id never seen before its obvious that he did his homework for this role studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged Bach and Goldoni each in their diverse way just give the movie luster Not only that but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution No stupid cheap tricks eyeballrolling dialog or pathetically cut corners A real treat for your collection

1	Many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with The Mortal Storm or Casablanca Everyone is entitled to compare films they choose but the similarities of The Mortal Storm and Watch On The Rhine are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the Nazi juggernaut while the main comparative point brought out with Casablanca is the seeming unjust treatment of Humphrey Bogart in 1943 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science because they chose Paul Lukas instead for the Best Actor Oscar It does not strike me as totally wrong Lukas had a good career in film both here and in England he is the villain in The Lady Vanishes and this performance was his best one Bogart had more great performances in him than Rick Blaine for instance he was ignored for Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Roy Earle in High Sierra two years earlier both of which were first rate performances and he would not get an Oscar for his greatest performances as Fred C Dobbs in The Treasure Of Sierra Madres the writermurder suspect in In A Lonely Place and Captain Philip Francis Queeg in The Caine Mutiny afterward he got it for Charley in The African Queen I think that Bogie should have got it for the role of Dobbs but it did not happen But Lukas was lucky he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career Few can claim thatbr br To me the film to look at with Watch On The Rhine is based on another playscript by Hellman The Searching Wind They both look at Americas spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s The Searching Wind is really looking at the whole interwar period while Watch On The Rhine set in the years just proceeding our entry into World War II deals with a few weeks of time Therefore it is better constructed as a play and more meaningful for its impact br br The film has many good performances led by Lukas as the exhausted but determined antiNazi fightercourier Davis as his loyal wife wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to Lukas being the center of the plays activities Coulouris as the selfish conniving but ultimately foolish and ineffective Teck Lucille Watson as the mother of Davis and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Coulouris wiser and sadder and fed up wife and Kurt Katch who delivers a devastating critique as the local embassys Gestapo chief about Coulouris and others who would deal with the Nazis It has dialog with bite in it And what it says is quite true It also has moments of near poetry Witness the scene towards the end when Coulouris is left alone with Lukas and Davis and says The New World has left the scene to the Old World Hellman could write very well at timesbr br Given the strength of the film script and performances I would rate this film highly among World War II films

0	The Omega Code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency There was a bit but precious little of good acting primarily by the two prophets and Rostenberg who only appeared once and had no lines Otherwise the acting was decidedly bad The plot line was rather weak and only partially based on already questionable Biblical interpretation Certainly not one of the years best

0	I had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations basically because of Kamal Hassan He is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever But this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen After watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better br br The Protagonist Raghavan is a very daring police officer Who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders Raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree Finally Raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent livesbr br THese two psychokillers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters The murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly which the movie could have survived without br br To even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty The director Gautham should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audienceCertainly i am never going to the movies looking like Gauthams name on the production list

1	I have seen this film several times and watched it today on TCM solely because of Geraldine Fitzgerald She is a much underrated actress and I have to admit I have had a crush on her since I first saw her probably in Wuthering Heights 40 or more years ago The real star in this movie however is Paul Lukas and he deserved all the accolades he got He makes it clear whether we like it or not that the end justifies the means Naziism had to be stopped and anything that helped do it was good He gave his children a line about being bad and that they should not be bad but as he said earlier when conversing with adults he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation Lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to dobr br Some people think his victim was a Nazi but I dont think so I think he was only after the money His Nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for himbr br One interesting point in the film and presumably also in the play is the fact that Muller Lucas is a German While the anti German hysteria of WWI was not repeated in WWII there was considerable antiGerman sentiment and some Germans were interred similar to what happened in California with people of Japanese ancestry It was something of an act of bravery for Hellman to write a play about good Germans at this time maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the NaziSoviet pact After all the US and British air forces were bombing German cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians I think however that the Dresden bombing and firestorm happened later after Watch on the Rhine was releasedbr br The title is something of a play on words as the watch is looking west from Germany In fact Watch am Rhein was a German army marching song used in WWII but the Nazis had their own marching song that was used as well But Muller IS a German and he is engaged in his own Wach am Rheinbr br All the other actors did an excellent job here although Bodo was too much there are children like him I am surprised he did not give his fathers secret away In real life he may very well have done so
0	Now I flicked onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching in the same way that you watch a car crashbr br I appreciate the fact its a spoof but that should not stop me from criticising the godawful directing acting and dialogue Seriously this rated as one of the poorest movies I have seen it looked more like an episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper and a poor one at thatbr br Okay a few criticisms 1 when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster we never see the monster attack him so we assume its a heart attack the army then launch shells rockets bullets at the monster which was feet from the doctor yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive 2 the army attack from about 100 yards away and we see a flamethrower being used geez those things have a range of no more than 30 metres 3 when the monster tries to take the professor the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling the monster drops the kid and the soldiers dont try to shoot the monster come on 4 the monster looks like it something out of Power Rangers 5 there is one scene where the five good guys the priest the girl the doctor the reporter and the kid all look shocked and we get reactions along the lines of hand to mouth one after the other so natural 6 the general just runs away time after time 7 the general refuses to try electricity and wouldnt listen 8 the acting is awful 9 did I mention the rubber suit monster 10 that godawful music nonstop
1	this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young it had everything that was great with 90s kids movies lovable dinosaurs cute kids an eccentric villain and a few great songs and not the typical little mermaidbeauty and the beast type songs but ones that are atually entertaining i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever i recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie and i definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations sorry not the most informative im in kinda a rush just please trust me all who go against this movie are killing their inner child
1	James Cagney is best known for his tough characters and gangster roles but he has also played quite a lot soft characters in his career This musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie Cagney would star inbr br Cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing And it needs to be said that he was not bad at it He plays the role with a lot of confidence He apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time so it actually isnt a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career He obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him inbr br The movie is directed by Lloyd Bacon who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre His earliest 30s musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as 42nd Street His musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really 30s musicals never were really about its singing this was something that more featured in 40s and later made musicals mainly from the MGM studiosbr br As usual it has a light and simple story set in the musical world that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way It nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch So do the characters and actors that are portraying them Sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routinesbr br The musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done even though Im not a too big fan of the genre itself Once again the musical numbers also feature a young Billy Barty he often played little boysbabiesmice and whatever more early on in his career including the movie musical Gold Diggers of 1933 of one year earlier br br A recommendable early genre moviebr br 810
1	This is a wonderful film The nonstop patter takes several watchings to fully appreciate The musical productions of Busby Berkeley will never be duplicated I think this movie easily outdoes all of his other efforts Joan Blondell and James Cagney are incredible together Some of the humor would almost push the boundaries of todays movies Put rational explanation of how they did it aside and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is
0	Absolutely fantastic br br Now before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattés allow me to elaborate Much as I enjoyed it this is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen and is certainly the worst film Ive seen at the cinema an impressive claim as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen The two leads Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst Of course they werent helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a Daphne Celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the OJ defence The plot to stretch the term slightly was thin to nonexistent and the gore scenes whilst undoubtedly brutal were irrelevant and laughably formulaic What plot there is revolves around a twentysomething model Cuthbert who is abducted imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures both psychological and physical The torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience Whilst there really are very very few positives to draw from this film its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema Within twenty minutes the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout For my part I came out flushed with laughter buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling filmmaking Whichever way you look at it this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a filmbr br PS I omitted to mention that I managed to get in to the film freeso I can afford to laugh about it I was still tempted to ask for my money backit really was THAT bad
0	This film was hard to get a hold of and when I eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming I mean this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and GETS AWAY with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt With all of this builtin interest how could anyone make such a lackluster talkladen flick of this truelife event While Williams is always interesting the screenwriters assumed that the DB Cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star s what we get is a typewithout any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off Harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction Shame on this film for even existing

1	Ardh Satya is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success Even today Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of Indiabr br The film tells the Reallife Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s Unlike any Police of other cities in India Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environmentbr br Amongst various Police officers colleagues the film describes the story of Anand Velankar a young hotblooded Cop coming from a poor family His father is a harsh Police Constable Anand himself suffers from his fathers ideologies incidences of his fathers Atrocities on his mother Anands approach towards immediate action against crime is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anands constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniorsThis leads to frustrations as he cannot achieve the desired Jobsatisfaction Resulting from the frustrations his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms bars also turning him to an alcoholicbr br The Spirit within him is still alive as he constantly fights the system He is aware of the system of the Metro where the Police Politicians are a inertly associated by far end His compromise towards unethical practice is negative Finally he gets suspendedbr br The Direction is a master piece thoroughly hard core One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shettys house to arrest him followed by short conversation which is fantastic At many scenes the film has Hairraising momentsbr br The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch Alcoholism Corruption Political Influence Courage Deceptions all are integral part of Mumbai police even today Those aspects are dealt brilliantlybr br Finally the films belongs to the One man show Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly
1	I think this show is definitely the greatest show Jessica Alba does such a great job in it Michael Weatherly also does an awesome job as well as the rest of the cast The show is very intriguing and they have wonderful storylines and their stunts are amazing Its like watching a 1hour movie Its definitely worth watching
1	Dolph Lundgren is back Detention marks Dolphs first film in nearly 2 years and that is following the delayed Hidden Agenda This film still marks an improvement for Dolph over his cheapie trilogy of Jill Rips Agent Red and Stormcatcher However this film is well below the standard of Hidden Agenda which was better in almost every respect What this film does have in its favour from Dolphs previous outing is a sense of cheesy fun The film also has a rejuvenated Dolph back in a high action role and its good to see Dolph doing his own stunts againbr br The films story is ludicrous and prime Bmovie material An exmilitary man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching whilst taking a Detention class he runs into some Slovakian bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal The film has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches If you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy Thankfully the filmmakers dont take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability this film has a so bad its enjoyable kind of vibebr br Where the film is let down is missusing a fairly decent budget The budget of around 10 million has not been well spent Its all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the shootouts lack imagination The opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse There are some good moments You have a car careering through school hallways for example and a decent shootout at the beginning with plenty of destruction The rest of the shootouts are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on onscreen br br As for the cast Hidden Agenda boasted the best cast Dolph has worked with in ages There was a good standard of actors for a DTV film This however has problems The actors are on the most part bad The bad guys are terrible but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because Alex Karsis plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness The teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters They all hate authority each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons but generally they are decent and Chris Collins in particular has a likeability This movie is all about Dolph though While this film is nowhere near his best it is nowhere near his worst It also marks a turning point in his career He is now back in good shape and will be in even better shape in his next film Direct Action Dolph looks enthusiastic here he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man running from explosions in slowmo one liners and handling large weapons again in a movie like his older ones albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like Army Of One It is good to see Dolph looking energised His films of the last 8 or so years have seen Dolph looking a little more weary and using doubles a lot he still does all the fights himself though but the new streamlined Dolph seems up for itbr br Overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and Dolph in prime action man mode Theres not a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm

0	Summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to whats the hottest movie of the week given 999 of the screens dedicated to screening it OK so I may exaggerate on the percentage but you get my drift Besides stuff from Hollywood Bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters and from some of the trailers shown Im hyped to watch them too Tashan was billed as one of THE most highly anticipated for 2008 but I was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas When I watched Jodha Akbar it was a full house but it wasnt for Tashanbr br After watching it I knew why It was entertaining but it was fundamentally weak Just like its literal English title which means Style Tashan is all style but little substance Not that it doesnt have the usual star power but scenes felt forced and some bordered on a tad ridiculous even for Bollywood standards I must say Which is quite surprising given that Tashan is directed and written by Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote Dhoom and Dhoom 2 both of which I enjoyed tremendously br br In his rookie directorial outing with Tashan while you cant fault his direction youd probably scratch your head over the plot which was clunky at best It tried to force too many things into the story though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation but that came a little too late and only toward the finale which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a Thai action movie with Hong Kongs wirework and Hollywoods ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil And in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink you have an assortment of vehicles appearing and the one that took the cake in a Dhoom 2 homage was the jetski boat in the middle of nowherebr br At best Tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters Saif Ali Khan plays Jimmy Cliff a call center executive who gives English tuition only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material His playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with Pooja Singh Kareena Kapoor whos not exactly who she seems the meek and sweet natured hottie She engages Jimmys services for her boss mobster Bhaiyyaji Anil Kapoor who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken English and phrases must like how an ahbeng does it And to complete the quartet Akshay Kumar plays Bachchan Pandey an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by Bhaiyyaji to hunt down Jimmy and Pooja when they escape with money stolen from Bahiyyajis businessbr br So begins a road trip of sorts with friends who turned enemies and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on Jimmy Cliff is probably the most implausible of all because he goes from zero to hero executing moves that would shame Rambo in absolutely no time which is quite out of character Kareena Kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee Every character has a backstory created and I thought Akshay Kumars Bachchan Pandey was probably the best the most touching and the most fun of the lot even though his character seemed a lot like a nongreen Incredible Hulk with his gravitydefying leaps and power packing punches His wounds also heal automatically which impressively puts Wolverine to shame And the best part is his theme song which is damn alphamale and played in rara mode each time he takes on adversariesbr br But sad to say thats the only tune that is memorable something that cheers Bachchan PandeyBachchanPandey For most Bollywood movies I watch I will usually be able to despite the obvious language gaps emerge from screenings humming a tune or two I wasnt able to do that after Tashan because the songs unfortunately just werent catchy at all Usually the songdance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location That I enjoy versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain or atop jagged rocks on the beach frontbr br Tashan probably didnt take itself too seriously but coming from Vijay Krishna Acharyas story you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous and for continuity to be a little more careful as well Billed as a blockbuster now I can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one Despite Akshay Kumr stealing the show Tashan could have been better on the whole
0	I argued with myself whether to rent this or not Im always afraid of renting something Ive never heard of dont remember this being in theaters Great castthats what tipped the scales 30 minutes in I almost stopped watching it The first few minutes are fun to watch but unbelievable It only gets worse after that The writers of this movie could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their movies even a little better Or they could just try writing something just a little bit believable I give it a 3a 1 for the writing only because there are wordsand a 2 for being able to get so many good actors to agree to do this movie despite having to read the script Oh my god this movie sucks
0	This is a well made informative film in the vein of PBS Frontline The problem is Frontline already did this piece and managed to bring L Paul Bremer in to tell his side of the story More troubling is the fact that the director of the film Charles Fergusona former think tank wonk was a war supporter until the occupation went south What did he think would happen br br The invasion of Poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky NazisAnd that is what this film feels likean apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself br br Ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run betteras if any war can be better

1	First saw this gem from Joe Sarno way back when and I must say that after seeing it I could never forget Jennifer Welles At first I thought the film was moving a bit slower than i would expect for a Sarno film but when Jennifer made her entrance the first time I ever saw her anywhere I was sat up and took notice Her presence in this film is hard to avoid and spices up every scene shes involved in Ive seen most of the rest of Sarnos films and the other films starring or featuring Jennifer Welles and I must say that this was both Sarno and Jennifer at their collective best Sarnos direction in this film of domestic adult drama is superb and Jennifer showed figuratively and literally an acting prowess that make this a must see Costars Rebecca Brooke aka Mary Mendum and Chris Jordan both frequent costars of Ms Welles and also frequent stars of Sarnos work turn in believable performances as a pair of adventurous yet normal housewives This film is Sarno classic
1	The events of September 11 2001 do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two French brothers In my view it would have been better to leave this out I think the directors tried too hard perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop The comment of one of a policemen this aint fing Disneyworld is aptbr br Nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events The filmakers were in all the right places at the right times no other footage from the day matches what they shot
1	This is a beautiful rich and very wellexecuted film with a rich and meaningful story Basically it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a male heir to carry on his craft but ends up not getting what he expected in his very maledominated world The characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and societys traditional notionsbr br The story is fun emotional and complex The exploration of the characters their lives and emotions is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all The film expertly conveys the old mans emotions and his desire to find an heir and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation There is also humour sometimes quite subtle at appropriate points The film also examines the good and bad of traditional Chinese culture creating further interest and depth to the filmbr br The directing acting and scenery are all outstanding Added to the other strengths this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling real characters As a result the film evokes strong empathy for and feelings about the charactersbr br Some have claimed that the ending weakens the film but I do not necessarily agree Perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small

1	King of Masks Bian Lian in China is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film Winner of 16 awards from around the world this film based on a true story centers on Wang Bianlian a street performer in 1930s China who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of facechange opera He has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance and no one knows how he does it He has a longing desire to have a grandson as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir We then go to the streets and see that people are selling their children because they cant afford to take care of them some are even begging to take their daughters for free because daughters are not worth much in this society Wang Bianlians story goes on from therebr br The film was so astonishingly good the acting was amazing and the issues were so weighty and welladdressed There is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place no one wants a little girl Also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the Living Bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman and while he is famous and wellrespected he regards himself as something low a half woman As we go further into the film the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it the brutality and corruption of the military and police and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentionsbr br This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life and Xu Zhu the actor who plays Wang Bianlian presents yet another beautiful performance

0	When Sam Peckinpahs superlative THE WILD BUNCH 1969 opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultraviolence it did so with a talented if whiskymarinated hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by Peckinpahs epic and SOLDIER BLUE definitely falls into that categorybr br SOLDIER BLEW er BLUE tells the story of foulmouthed New Yorker Cresta Lee Candice Bergen a blonde protohippie chick whos been rescued from two years of captivity among the Cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where shell be reunited with the fiancée she only wants to marry for his money Also on board the wagon shes traveling in is a shipment of government gold cash the Cheyenne need to buy guns with so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and Cresta flees to the hills accompanied by Honus Gant Peter Strauss the lone surviving cavalryman Calling Gant by the snarky nickname Soldier Blue Cresta demonstrates that her years among the savages was time well spent outstripping Gant in survival skills common sense and sheer balls and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements a band of hostile Kiowa an unscrupulous trader  played by Donald Pleasance here giving one of his most ridiculous performances and thats saying something  and in the tradition of many previous westernset romantic comedies each otherbr br During the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably  and predictably  attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on  while Gant has a freshly treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg no less  in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that wasnt filled with rattlesnakes mountain lions or who knows what to say nothing of the Cheyenne who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment there I go thinking in NYC real estate terms again br br Realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave Cresta leaves Gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge wont spare a couple of men so they can rescue Gant the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby Cheyenne village and once Cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubbytobe and makes a beeline straight to the Cheyenne to warn them of whats coming br br What happens next is what gained the film its infamy it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a leadin to a hideous reenactment of the 1864 Sand Creek Massacre an orgy of rape torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of keeping the country clean and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty Children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses or impaled on bayonets unarmed people are beheaded  a nice effect I have to admit  women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes then raped and mutilated  in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act  and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered their compone nt parts impaled on pikes and waved about in victorious celebration or kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs No joke this scene would instantly garner an NC17 rating if released today to say nothing of possibly spurring Native American interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depictedbr br Im all in favor of westerns that dont shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won or stolen if truth be told but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be one minute its a heavyhanded pseudohippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up well DUH then its a lighthearted battle of the sexes farce wherein Cresta proves herself five times the man Gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho with no undies but that all goes out the window when Donald Pleasance shows up with an unintentionally hilarious pair of bucktoothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a subplot that goes nowhere all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax Any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the films promotion and poster imagery br br But by trying to be all things to all audiences SOLDIER BLUE ends up as an incoherent preachy Mulligan stew of presumably wellintentioned political correctness but if they were going to tell the story of the Sand Creek Massacre wouldnt it have been a good idea to have some Indian characters who were more than just walkons with Murphy Brown acting as their mouthpiece We get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure gorehound moviegoers into seeing the most savage film in history If you like me were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its daring to tell it like it was take my word for it and let SOLDIER BLUE slowly fade into cinematic obscurity
1	The first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame It presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of blackclad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her The hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers her hand smashed with a hammer her eye punctured with a needle and so forthbr br In the most nauseating scene the womans captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns The series received a great deal of publicity when American actor Charlie Sheen believing the series to contain actual murder attempted to ban its distribution in the United States An FBI investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers sick recreations using nasty but obvious special effects Gruesomely staged by acclaimed Japanese comicbook artist Hideshi Hino who also directed the third and fourth episodes this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms But gorehounds probably wont find anything special
1	Titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the illfated voyage on the unsinkable ship WriterDirector James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet They make for a good onscreen couple DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane Kathy Bates Frances Fisher Jonathan Hyde and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film The love story the action suspense and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for its few flaws Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the illfated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch

0	Raising victor Vargas is just a bad film No amount of denial or addollar supported publicity with change this sad factbr br Maybe Peter Sollett saw he didnt have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current edgy filmmaking Maybe he just doesnt know any better Its hard to tellbr br Whats not hard to tell is the result Except for a few viewers who will intellectualize the bad filmmaking into an attempt at pseudorealism few will enjoy itbr br I know I didntbr br Do yourselves a favor and pass on this film
1	089 Footlight Parade 1933 released 9301933 viewed 5507br br The ice cream cone is invented in New Yorkbr br KEVIN After a long and busy break we hit another Busby Berkeley musical from Warner Bros This time its the ultrafast paced Footlight Parade starring James Cagney as juggernaut stage producer Chester Kent I am 100 certain that Cagney was channeling Berkeley with his performance of the irrepressible Kent who has to come up with new ideas for performances every minute Joan Blondell is also excellent as the acidtongued secretaryturnedlove interest The Ruby KeelerDick Powell subplot is not as major this time but no less enjoyable One thing that baffled me was Berkeleys performances themselves which seemed far too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage let alone a stage that would be showing a film afterwards Obviously Busby doesnt let a little thing like story impede him from putting together the most overthetop musical numbers he can possibly conjure I liked nearly all of this movie until the end with the shamelessly offensive number Shanghai Lil which as one can guess is about as stomachturning as racially distasteful performances comebr br DOUG Six movies in three months Got to be a new record Anyway this completes Warner Bros musical trilogy of 1933 preceded by 42nd Street and Gold Diggers of 1933 I would definitely recommend watching all three in a row I wonder if James Cagney was channeling Busby Berkeley while he was playing Chester Kent in this movie or if that the role as written was inspired by Busby I hope it was it seems to make sense that Berkeley is the kind of guy who would see elaborate dances in everyday occurrences the way Chester does The funny thing about Cagney was that he didnt really look like a leading man in the traditional sense He was 57 squareheaded and talked with an odd New York accent But the guy was quite versatile going from the venomous gangsters that made him so famous to the fasttalking producertypes we see here And he could dance Basically he was a leading man in the body of a character actor The rest of the cast has some familiar faces Joan Blondell returns and just about steals the show as Cagneys loyal and lusting secretary Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler play the cute couple but seem to get less screen time than before Billy Barty pops up again as the mischievous imp The movie is typical of the more racy and adultoriented musicals of the preCode era as opposed to those of the 50s and 60s that were more family oriented and is an excellent climax of the Warner musicals of that year the Shanghai Lil number not withstanding with Keeler doing a poor job at looking Chinesebr br Last film Dinner At Eight 1933 Next film Im No Angel 1933
1	The filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic I liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the 1930s Chinesemainland countryside as well as more basic human questions I felt I could get a real sense of the times recreated even in splendid shots of traditional Chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living It seemed worthwhile to experience The interwoven role which Buddhism plays is probably the most truetoform both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect perhaps the most effective that Ive seen in Chinese film Casting is great Images are memorable Acting is solid enough Thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression
0	The Darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film while F Murray Abraham was in it Spoilers About halfway through FMurray gets zapped because The Darkling is some kind of demonlike creature who enjoys living vicariously He takes bums and losers and perverts them further while giving them all they want in terms of success He feeds from their enjoyment of the Seven Deadly Sins However part of it is that he needs to get people who may be flawed but not completely evil Otherwise he cannot pervert their natural goodness Thats what the little guy said in his Barry White voice which I found both charming and amusing Mostly amusing Like imagine Barry White if he were a little dwarf and he was telling Aiden Gillen Dee Plane Dee Plane Bos Here eet come Dee Plane All through the movie Dee Dwarf actually a robotronic cherub talks to Aiden Gillen in the Barry White voice saying things like Its OK to be bad you know you want it Now youve committed murder youre really moving up in the world and other remarks that sound like commercials for Being Evil Stores or something It really is hilarious in a sick waybr br Anyhow Aiden Gillen is no F Murray Abraham and the movie tanks as soon as Murray gets the axe or knifed F Murray brings a certain happy malevolence to his role in this film He is a good actor Aiden Gillen on the other hand has a permanent happy smirk on his face and he looks like maybe his remedial English Comp class had never hit the Mythological Characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about The ENDING is really creepy and yet almost comical If this movie were a parody the ending was perfect If it was not a parody then it was creepy but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a grossout that the movie itself could not deliver The people who made this movie lost whatever it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the ending It just ends like they just realized that they had run out of money and had to film a quickie ending
0	I truly wish I was not writing this review Im a Christian so I waited anxiously to see this movie It seemed great a Christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing not that I buy the Bible Code itself you can make it say anything you want I do however believe everything inside the Bible So Im sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes I had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while I was in the theater I would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable Tension Scenes Im sure Once the final credits began to roll however I could reflect There were many parts of the movie I liked some mostly unexpected plot twists some effects that were indeed special Im not counting the Visions Those were poorly done and some interesting technical work fades sets that type of thing Unfortunately I got the distinct impression that if I read the book of Revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour I couldve gotten a better script And the music was beyond cheesy even for a Bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue So I wish I could be like everyone else in the theater like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was but Im not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a Biblical shell and slaps a Christian stamp on it I need a good plot and believable dialogue before I can enjoy most movies and this just didnt have either Im sorry but I wouldnt recommend this film to anyone And thats the tragedy When will we see some intelligent Christian fiction It has to be out there somewhere
1	Now many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title If you do not have the stomach for gory movies then what are you doing reading this review Anyhow I borrowed the video from a friend of mine and fell in love with this movie immediately This movie is chock full of wonderful gore plus the usual other ingredients that make up a bmovie add up to one hell of a viewing experience If youre a lover of good quality experiences then by all means watch this great flick
1	Opening the film with a Bach Toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama All the compositional devices Bach perfected to keep his listener and the performer intrigued and entertained applies to this film There isnt a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene I feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad Mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but I feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor If Mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders I wonder how this work would have ended As it exists it is very somber and mean spirited

1	I always thought this would be a long and boring TalkingHeads flick full of static interior takes dude I was wrong Election is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thrillerdrama taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of TriadsRituals Characters are constantly on the move and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider its still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters Furthermore Johnnie To succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric lightshadow contrasts Although theres hardly any action the ending is still shocking in its ruthless depicting of brutality Cool movie that deserves more attention and I came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit

1	House of Games is a flawlessly constructed film and one of the few films I have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends I first saw it on video a few years back after reading Roger Eberts review which proclaimed it the best film of 1987 I had my doubts mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year Boy was I in for a surprise This was one of the smartest most wellwritten movies I had ever seenbr br The screenplay is quite a piece of work not only in terms of the plot which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out but also in terms of character development On my second viewing I began to realize that Mamets screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations The climax of the movie is particularly effective because it is absolutely inevitable It stems naturally from what we know about the characters and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending The performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add enormously to the film I cannot picture any other actor besides Mantegna playing the role of Mike and Crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset Their work plus Mamets extraordinary screenplay combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980s It is truly a mustsee
1	The premise of this movie has been tickling my imagination for quite some time now Weve all heard or read about it in some kind of context What would you do if you were all alone in the world What would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes In fact the last part is actually what happens to Dave and Andrew two roommates living in a rundown house in the middle of a freeway system Andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and Dave is considered being one of the biggest losers of society That alone is the main reason to why these two guys get so well along because they simply only have each other to turn to when comforting is needed Just untilbr br Straight from the beginning of the film lots and lots of problems happen to them Both of them get involved with crime Andrew suffers from paranoia and simply doesnt dare going out of the house Dave is unsuccessful at his job and his colleagues dont treat him very well and with the respect he deserves The amount of problems they face keeps increasing until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it This is just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away And of course that is exactly what happensbr br The rest of the story places Dave and Andrew in this world of nothingness At first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seems as if they are the only ones still leftbr br Nothing features an incredibly small cast in fact besides the first couple of shots from the film we only see Dave David Hewlett and Andrew Andrew Miller in the entire film It is clear that in order to pull this off the cast has to be more than up for the task because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way Vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of closeup head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well Director of Photography Derek Rogers also has a nice way of teasing the audience by withholding visual information especially at times where a character sees something and reacts to it but we dont see it right awaybr br Obviously this cant be an event driven film and its not Much of the action happens outside their house when they move around in the void And thats where some of the most hilarious scenes take place especially in the case of when Andrew discovers a candy barbr br Now one could be thinking How does nothing look like Well it looks like nothing indeed The entire world of nothing is white white no matter in what direction you look This is the weakness of this film After an hour or less its getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure its more interesting to look at Thank God there are some For example at times when the two lads due to the properties of nothing are able to jump really high as if nothing is made out of tofu as Andrew claims Its fun to see how they are instantly able to use nothing to become gods of their own little societybr br One of the best parts of the film is the set Production designer Jasna Stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally fun to look at still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this All in all the production design is with no doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film at it really makes the film worth watchingbr br However the very best part of the film is the acting Both David Hewlett and Andrew Miller really look like the professional actors they both are The camera is on them for every second of the film and as previously said there are just about no props in the film they are really on a bare stage With plenty of character development and some decent oneliners clever dialogue at times hilariously stupid it all works to that end and this really moves the movie away from the lowbudget area to wellcrafted handworkbr br Lets talk a little about the visual effects because they are definitely worth mentioning Nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film Theres a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film and although The Drews have milked that scene completely its still fun to watch One of the best visual effects in the film is at the end where Andrew and Dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment they have the abilities to wish everything away so what if they can do it the other way around and make things appearbr br Nothing is a bright and welllit movie it really helps promoting the idea of them probably being dead this is in fact one of their theories but Nothing is a comedy and it slowly destroys its own theory We dont know where they are or what has happened to them We dont know if they will ever get out because the movie ends before we see anything like that The ending by the way is not as good as it couldve been Its rather easy to predict what is going to happen still the writers have thought up a few incidents that help make it a little more interesting and in the end its a reasonably satisfactory onebr br Take Hollow Man Kill Bill Cube Epoch and lots of other films and you have Nothing It really is an amalgam of different styles still there is no other film at least that I know of Nothing is really like For the people remembering the original Cube Production Commentary on its DVD may remember that Vincenzo Natali talked about how he came up with the story of Cube He talks about him and André Bijelic having been roommates at a time and they both were in this extremely dull room with no hope of getting out Nothing could very well be the screened version of the origin of the Cube story and to that end its almost like one of the Cube prequelsbr br What can I say I enjoyed Nothing it is a great movie and the different parts of the movie are extremely wellmade with tons of intelligent ideas still I feel the movie is missing something and I have problems finding out precisely what it is Maybe if we have a Nothing 2 I can answer that question Nothing is a great film but not as good as I expected it to bebr br Final rating 75 10
1	Some films just simply should not be remade This is one of them In and of itself it is not a bad film But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of Owen Wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in its attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more
1	I agree with what veinbreaker wrote with regards to the Ahhhh feeling you get at the end of this movie I absolutely loved the locations they chose to film the songs were well written and interesting especially the psychedelic sounding track on which Hans Matheson sings Its trippy Nighy was fab in his role Nail nailed it Beano was the typical drummer and Rea kept it together Bruce Robinson was awesome Helena was a lovely girlfriend But I felt Juliet Aubreys performance was gorgeous The scenes between Aubrey Robinson killed me Perfectly played and the music behind the scene was spot on Too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out They ought toIve told all my musician friends great quote by Jimmy Nails character its supposed to be rock roll not the Phantom of the fg opera
1	This movie is the first of the six infamous Guinea Pig Movies and is one of the best At the same time it looks realistic and unrealistic just knowing that the movie is fake The story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways A man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address and it includes a manga video showing the torture The men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die Some scenes are shocking such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched 100 times because you see punches in nearly every movie This movie has a lot of gore so I would recommend this to people 17 or olderbr br 910
1	I wasnt sure what to expect but am I glad I went to see this A smart slightly twisted comedy that makes you think I wasnt quite sure how a director can create nothing but leave it to Mr Natali and the brilliant individuals at CORE to create another low budget set that looks real as real as nothing can be Well worth your time and money if you have the opportunity to see this please go Youll be glad you did
0	I regret every single second of the time I lost while watching this movie really Unhappily I always find it hard to switch off a movie once I started watching it Especially when its such a classic or what people use to call a classic I think that this is one of those movies every movielover should have watched at least one time so that was why I watched it Dont get me wrong I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall both as a couple and as actors but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion No really good plot neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story Well not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres Only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether Bogey and Bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another I think To Have and Have Not is very overrated and Bogart was in many better films during the 1940s
1	I stumbled across this ActI by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago This wasnt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned It amazed me It intimidated me It shocked me I eventually forgot about and almost a decade later I happened to think about it again Then went and bought both acts They were even better than I had experienced at firstbr br My only complaint is that while the Tank Police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime warranting tanks and heavy artillery it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals That is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time If that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda it certainly has not been shown as suchbr br I dont think the original Japanese version could have been any where as good as the Americanized version of this But regarding the story there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused
0	What the hell of a DMovie was that Bad acting bad special effects and the worst dialoguesstoryline i ever came across The only cool thing here was Coolio who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop However the rest of the film is awful and boring Its not even so bad you can laugh about it Just plain crap And whoever compares this to the Evil Dead Series might as well compare Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones well ok at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider 1 out of 10

1	Over Her Dead Body was a nice little movieIt was decent and entertaining while still being pretty funnyThere were a few clichés but I found most stuff freshAt first I didnt think it was going to be good at allwhen it started outIf you can get past the first 20 minutes thoughthe movie starts getting more interestingThis film wasnt burst out in laughter hilariousand wasnt OH MY GOSH wonderfulIt was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it wasI dont see how this movie was badIts rating is just a bit too lowI couldve dealt with a 55but a 48Alsogiving this movie a 1 is disgracefulIt was pretty goodand there was nothing horrible enough about it to give it a 1which is what most people gave it
1	Spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love and mom and dad can have fun watching as well Growing up in the 80s I enjoyed this movie its plot and all the actors I recently purchased this movie on DVD so when I have kids of my own they will be able to have as much fun watching this movie as I did The plot is fun A group of kids embark on a journey they never expected when they were rocketed into space by a overachieving robot They were in auh at first but when they realized they didnt have enough oxygen to make it back panic sunk in Once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station they returned to earth as even better friends and a new found respect for life
1	This is truly truly one of the best movies about love that Ive ever seen Closely followed by none other than Before Sunset which technically isnt another movie at all since its about the same two people and the same romancebr br This is love in the real world OK thats only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie Reading the other reviews it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialogbased movies as well And this is what makes Before Sunrise so good The dialog is perfect Its so real so engaging and funny Its hardly a surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love coz you fall in love with them at the very same timebr br My favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop where they pretend to phone their best friends with the other pretending to be said best friend Its PERFECT Brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your lifebr br I must say that if you have a choice do watch Before Sunrise before watching Before Sunset If like me you watched Sunset first its hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire showbr br Once again the greatest romantic movie in my books Wonderful acting excellent script and beautiful locations Young love at its best
1	Ooverall the movie was fairly good a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes but Chuck Norris did hardly anything except for disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters The movie was very similar to the events of Sept 11 with a bin ladenlike terrorist sending a video to the president Urich and threatening to detonate it Judson Mills had some superb action roles taking out Rashids compound and various kickbutt roles but there was a lack of Chuck Norris Judson took over most of the action leaving Joshua chuck with Que on her computer But overall it was realistic and didnt lack the action but only did it on Mr Norris part I gave the film 710
1	ELEPHANT WALK may not be the acme of literature or of film but it is great entertainment in the quasimelodramatic mode It is the story of love both genuine and illicit as well as overweening ambition devotion and the arrogance of personal tyranny A previous reviewer John Mankin questions why the central focus of the film the mansion called Elephant Walk should have been built by the former owner the governor the late Tom Wiley right across the elephants traditional path to the major source of water the river To miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film the hubris of man That his son played by Peter Finch should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father is not unexpected since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his fathers rowdy boys club as his role models The point of the father was that he was a selfmade man who would tame nature to his liking and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd and thus he would dominate his son and all around him and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water Who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water This is the nexus of the film what will animals do to get water what will humans do to get power or love Ceylon todays Sri Lanka is the huge island off the coast of India where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story not just the expenses of Miss Taylor Were it not for this exotic location much of the film was shot in Ceylon and the magnificent bungalow this would have been just another potboiler One must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the English immigrant conquerors that were part and parcel of the British raj It is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony teak and marble Not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved Jalees grille work window and doorway borders evidently specified by art directors J McMillan Johnson and Hal Pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island Such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men soughtbr br For those immune to the blandishments of time place and architecture there is always the allure of Miss Taylor as she marries a man she doesnt really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man against the background described and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased As I said it is not great literature nor even great film but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of todaybr br This is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drivein not on the home TV so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camerawork and scope
1	Ill tell you a tale of the summer of 1994 A friend and I attended a Canada Day concert in Barrie and it was a whos who of the top Canadian bands of the age We got there about 4am waited in line most of the morning and when the doors opened at 9am we were among the first inside the gates We then waited and waited in the hot sun slowly broiling but we didnt care because the headliners were among our favourites At one point early in the afternoon I sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier I was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a Rheostatics tshirt This is the reason I have hated the Rheostatics to this day Theres nothing reasonable nor tastedetermined nor really anything except their fandom Snotty of me isnt it So I in my hatred of the band have denied myself the delight that is Whale Musicbr br Desmond Howl had it all Its hard to say what hes lost since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains the BC region where the movie was shot is breathtaking The life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams phantoms and his own past until the day a teenaged criminal breaks inand trite as it sounds breaks him outbr br Canadian cinema suffers from several problems Generally a lack of money as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help as if somehow the feature would cease to be Canadian leads to lower production values than American or British films and most people dont like to watch anything that sounds or looks like well not like an American film Next Canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story and tell it well Third they seem to think that gratuitous nudity often fullfrontal makes something artistic Im sure anyone who watches enough Canadian movies especially late at night on the CBC knows exactly what Im talking about Its almost like a dont do this handbook exists out there somewhere and Canadian filmmakers threw it out a long time agobr br In the 90s and 00s however some films such as Bruce McDonalds work and the brilliant CRAZY have broken this mold and managed to maintain what makes them Canadian while holding onto watchable production values and great stories Whale Music is such a film on the surface Deeper than just its Canadianisms its a deeply moving story of a man whos lost his grip through grief and excess who is redeemed by music then by love And that redeems even the Rheostatics
1	I really have to disagree with guyyardleyrees who should he have watched the entire film would have seen some absolutely stunning Scottish scenery some of the best ever shot in Skye and found a film with a difficult start come together into a really poignant wholebr br This is not a big budget film Rather it is a film that has a strong community feelbr br I cant say how much standard films bore me pushing out the same polished stuff again and again Seachd doesnt seem to be about that at all It really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more Gaelic than any recent Scottish filmbr br OK so the acting isnt in the style a blockbuster Thats because the actors are seemingly real people I actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his Grandfather were really convincing and at times unusually beautifulbr br Seachd really bears a second viewing since there are many threads that become clearer second time around that really do feed into the endingbr br Overall the combination of music and at times stunning visuals plus a community approach to the acting and nonnormal structure has turned Seachd into quite a distinctive and memorable film More of these please
1	Its a good movie maybe I like it because it was filmed here in PR The actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome The guy is cute too so its a good match if you want to the guy or the girls

1	this dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard throwback action flick it isnt going to win any awards and its not very original but it delivers the goods you would want to see from a dolph lundgren movie our man dolph is an ex soldier who is now a teacher at a tough inner city high school and when it gets taken over by terrorists its up to him to save the day sure the script isnt going to win any Oscars its good fun and it has its fair share eplosive action dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance but he comes alive more in the action scenes and the rest of the cast are not the best actors but they hold it well all in all detention is an enjoyable action flick but youve seen it a million times before
0	Youve gotta hand it to Steven Seagal whatever his other faults may be he does have good taste in women If you pick a Seagal movie chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it And usually they do not function as mere eye candy they get involved in the action and fight shoot guns kill with knives etc Flight of Fury offers the duo of Ciera Payton who has a very sexy face with luscious lips to match Angelina Jolies and Katie Jones and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight AND a little lesbian fondling And if it seems like Im spending a little too much time talking about them its because the rest of the movie although passable is so unexciting that its hard to find much else to talk about Ironically the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself who looks as if he cant even be bothered to try to pretend to care This being a militarytype actioner there is very little fighting in it and he doesnt fit into his role a stealth fighter pilot the best in the world of course very well which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking 12
1	Faith and Mortality viewed through the lens of an elderly Ashkenazi JewishAmerican gentleman and a younger AfricanAmerican Jewish gentleman who waver between being at odds with each other and having frank talks about how their lives have unfolded over the yearsbr br Mostels character is a tailor with chronic back problems and a terminally ill wife Belafontes character is a career hustler never settling on a regular job and a fatal car accident leaves him in an odd Purgatory he must convince Mostel to renew his faith as it has been failing along with his wifes health and his own but Belafontes Levine has his own problems still pining for the girlfriend he left behindbr br Belafontes character leaves the film before he seemingly should and so the the ending is cryptic and the film suffers somewhat from its ambiguous endingbr br This is not a typical Hollywood movie on ethnic relations or about a persons crisis of faith it is worth watching more than once and appreciating the excellent performances of the principal actors

1	This review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is basedbr br The right to be presumed Innocent until proven guilty is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society but according to Fred Schepisis partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous Australian murder trial it was not granted to Lindy Chamberlain accused of killing her baby The story suggesting her innocence was unlikely a dingo was alleged to have taken it but those implying her guilt even more so and there was no solid evidence against her But the Australian public was transfixed by the possibility of her guilt and the deeply religious Chamberlains appeared creepy when appearing in the media and the media themselves of course were anything but innocent in this process So although cleared by an initial inquest they were later prosecuted and convicted Although Chamberlain was eventually released this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence proving their innocence something no defendants should have to producebr br A Cry in the Dark is well acted throughout especially by Meryl Streep who puts on a convincing Australian accent at least to this Poms ears and manages keep Lindy sympathetic to us while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure The scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking because we believe in the characters as real br br Regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story something I cant comment on the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the British popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readerships least charitable instincts No legal system will ever be perfect but the current cry against asylum seekers in contemporary British tabloids comes from exactly the same pit of evil as the voices that put Lindy Chamberlain away Im not a religious man but the Bible still contains some killer lines if youll excuse the pun Judge not lest ye be judged is one of them

1	I was amazingly impressed by this movie It contained fundamental elements of depression grief loneliness despair hope dreams and companionship It wasnt merely about a genius musician who hit rock bottom but it was about a man caught up in grief trying drastically to find solace within his music He finds a companion who comes with her own issues Claire and Des were able to provide each other with friendship and love but more importantly a conclusion to events which had shaped their life for the worst br br Des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star Yet he has musical genius He also has an event in his past that has made him stagnate while things around him literally go to ruins His focus is creating his Whale Music in fact it becomes an obsession for himbr br Claire is the streetwise kid that needs a place to stay She finds hidden talents while being in Des company She also finds a mutual friend that accepts her She learns to trust him over a period of timebr br These two find love with one another Not the mind blowing sex infused kind of passion but a love where friendship and understanding means more For two people who have been hurt they find trust together
1	Cut is a fulltilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do Most of the standard slasher cliches are there the old creepy house the woods the anonymous indestructible serial killer buckets of gore and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while theyre having sex thats hardly a spoilerbr br The setup is simplicity itself filmschool nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher masterpiece unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast This also neatly okay messily disposes of Kylie Minogue in the first reel They are joined by one of the survivors of the original film played by Molly Ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines The rest of the cast fit their roles well especially the lovely Jessica Napier who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around herbr br There are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace It also has an appropriate low budget look including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate Good soundtrack too If there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a sendup of or a homage to the slasher genre Probably a bit of both
0	This is one very dire production The general consensus has always been that while Princess Margaret may have been spoilt and pampered and may have revelled in the excess of luxury at her disposal she was a very beautiful young woman Here was the productions weakest point the actress failed to get that across It also appeared that the production budget couldnt stretch to a hairdresser from the outset the hair on the Princess Margaret character had a permanent birds nest in disarray look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush The actor playing the Duke of Edinburgh appeared to have prepared for his role by watching Rory Bremner imitate Prince Charles and was farcicalbr br The production was a flaw ridden cliché ridden embarrassing load of rubbish I think all Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas

1	The only other review of this movie as of this date really trashes the stars and the movie itself I usually like to read the user comments to give me an idea of what to expect from a movie I dont know much about Its unfortunate when there arent many comments for a certain tile because when there is only one review and it unreasonably trashes the movie and cast you dont get an idea of what to expect I read the review before watching this title and I dont know where all the venom for this movie and the stars came from Douglas and Blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered even when the material was not the greatest I found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable It isnt one of the great alltime classics but a pleasant and funny diversionmuch more than you can hope for in most newer movies If you are a fan of these stars you will not be disappointed

0	the movie sucked it wasnt funny it wasnt exciting they tried to make it so bad that it would be good but failed and thinking its cool to like this movie next to the hype are the only reasons that this movie is a successbr br the fact that at this moment 50 voted a 10 out of 10 for this movie seems pretty concerning to me either the movie going public is going insane or this vote is unrealistic which can have numerous causes and should be dealt with anyway it is a less than average movie which bloomed through mouth to mouth advertising Its success can only be described as a marketing marvel
0	I cannot believe that this movie was ever created I think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse The zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup The zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes Finally there are maybe five or six zombies total definitely not a nation The best part of the movie if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished Again to reiterate other user comments the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie Also there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all It is never explained
1	Director Vincenzo Natali first showed his penchant for characterbased scifi flicks with his 1997 short film Elevated wherein 3 people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters roam the building His followup feature project Cube released later that year had a very similar premise this time with 6 people and instead of an elevator it was a vast expansion of interlocking cubic deathtraps Both were admirable attempts to take the scifi genre a step further by deliberately declining to show almost any visual stimulation choosing instead to spend as much time as possible focusing on the human element how the characters act react and interact under incomprehensible and dangerous conditions After his exploration into the mainstream with 2002s Cypher Natali has come back to his bizarre characterfilm trend to bring us Nothing his latest and by far most optimistic and comedic take on the wide cinematic world of What Ifbr br Dave David Hewlett and Andrew Andrew Miller are lifelong friends brought together by a mutual detachment from society and a lack of any one else to be with Dave who has always been hindered by a selfish and somewhat dimwitted nature lives rentfree with Andrew at his illlocated and illconstructed house where he often takes advantage of Andrews neurotic and antisocial mentality Despite all this the two misfits are happy together until one day their deep character flaws coupled with some astronomically bad luck land them in the middle of some pretty serious jailsentenceworthy trouble On top of this they discover that their house has been deemed unfit for existence and is scheduled to be demolished before sunset so in the hazy nightmarish panic of everything going wrong for them they wish that the whole world would just disappear And it doesbr br Going any further with the synopsis would compromise a lot of the films slow occasionally too slow reveal about whats happened to Dave and Andrew and how they deal with their new reality Natalis fascination with studying human behavior under duress ala The Birds is here in spades but simply by making the main characters friends rather than strangers hes able to break away from the thrillerhorror element of this premise to open it up to a more comfortable and optimistic level Its almost as if hes made the aphoristic opposite of Cubebr br Of course the film is not 85 minutes of laughter and sunshine In keeping with fundamental realism our two antiheroes dynamic often becomes antagonistic sometimes with rather nasty results Like the Desert Island game the film looks at how even best friends when left alone together can fall apart but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence In a very twisted scifi way this is a feelgood flick with good heart and good intentionsbr br However there are a few qualms to be had with Nothing While the two lead actors Hewlett and Miller do well with their parts their characters are not nearly as interesting as they should have been considering it is completely up to them to entertain us for the better part of an hour There is some development in the relationship and personalities of Dave and Andrew some background is given but ultimately not enough A generous viewer will sit through the lessengaging portions of the film to see it through to the end but cynics will probably give up pretty fastbr br Acting as mentioned is adequate and considering the amount of greenscreen work that wouldve been needed reasonably convincing David Hewlett and Andrew Miller who both wrote cowrote the screenplay have been longtime friends of Vincenzo Natali Hewlett has in fact featured in every film Natali has made Perhaps it was their creative input that steered this film in a more positive direction Nonetheless the story could have been a lot more involving Granted it is relatively entertaining considering that no pun intended nothing really happens but you get the impression that in more experienced hands a lot more couldve been done with this premisebr br In all fairness Nothing is an impressive piece of work in many ways The concept is interesting the direction is inventive the script works on a human level and most of all it shows a progression in Natalis creative mentality For fans of his work this will be a delight and for others it will be a nice way to pass a little unwanted time Its just a shame that the directors fixation on human drama prevented it from being the great fun film it could have been
1	Previously I wrote that I loved Titanic cried at its ending many times over and Im a guy in his 60s I also wondered about why this great movie which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics was given only a 70 rating by imdbcom usersbr br Well I looked at the breakdown of the user ratings While 290 of all votes gave it a 10 rating 107 gave it a 1 rating These 107 of these irrational imdb users in effect pulled the overall rating down to 70 br br In my previous comments I blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in 1 ratings with a high 10 rating dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level on only one thing hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio Believe me Ive tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men mostly who defame him left and right They absolutely hate the man and they will have no part in giving him any credit in Titanic To answer one other user I am NOT talking about someone who just really doesnt like the movie that much and gave it a 5 or a 6 etc Everyone has and is entitled to hisher own taste But no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 70 overall for Titanic pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings is a fair reflection of the overall motion picturebr br Let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of Titanic to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more but these 5 will prove my point Heavens Gate 1980 was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing and imdb voters ratings were 232 10 ratings and 92 1 ratings overall rating of 61 Big Top Peewee 1988 got 43 10 ratings and 99 1 ratings overall rating of 45 Cat People 1982 got 61 10 ratings and 26 1 ratings overall rating of 58 Blind Date 1987 got 30 10 ratings and 28 1 ratings overall rating of 53 Jumpin Jack Flash 1986 got 44 10 ratings and 37 1 ratings overall rating of 52 WHAT DO ALL OF THESE FILMS HAVE IN COMMON WITH TITANIC ALL OF THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 RATINGS ARE LOWER THAN TITANIC AND NONE OF THESE STINKERS EVER WAS NOMINATED FOR A SINGLE AWARD Again Titanic got 107 1 ratings Compare that to the other 5 movies I just mentionedbr br Can there be any explanation other than the hatred of Leo factorbr br
0	this movie offers nothing but the dumbest conversations possible as a matter of fact i most probably could not have imagined how meaningless a film how synthetic the dialogs could be until an hour ago but then again i saw this video in a movie that does not depend on a powerful script one expects to see at least good acting and tasty conversations and even some humor maybe yet this movie lacks them all you heard me it lacks them all there is not a single point i like about this movie none i hate it im sure anyone will do so too the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and stuff yet it fails even at the nudity i dont know how but i beared to watch this thing for an hour or so and i definitely recommend you dont do so worst movie ive seen in my entire life if someone offers you to watch it ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave your liiiiiiiiife

0	This movie is a disgrace to the Major League Franchise I live in Minnesota and even I cant believe they dumped Cleveland Yes I realize at the time the real Indians were pretty good and the Twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the American League but still be consistent Anyway I loved the first Major League liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the Indians would finally go all the way to the series You cant tell me this wasnt the plan after the second film was completed What Happened Anyways if your a true fan of the original Major League do yourself a favor and dont watch this junk

0	I saw an early screening of this film in New York and I along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience were vastly disappointed The movie wasnt even so bad it was good it was as lifeless as a snakebite victim Samual L Jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame It reminded me of one of those cheesy SciFi movies except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy It all seemed worn flat and overtly formulaic Im shocked to say I actually think Anaconda was more fun Its easy to understand that SOAP realizes its a piece of sit and plays along with it but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense Its the worst kind of lame movie its joyless

1	Another Aussie masterpiece this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural and it does very well It doesnt resort to the big special effects overkill like American flicks it focuses more on emotional impact A relatively simple plot that Rebecca Gibney Co bring to life It follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago Strange things begin to happen in the house and John Adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared who was actually a mass murderer Highly recommended 810

1	Given the title this first followup to QUARTET 1948 obviously reduces the number of W Somerset Maugham stories which comprise the film The author still turns up to introduce the episodes but there’s no epilogue this time around by the way while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to RC Sheriff here Maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation as well as Noel Langley though it’s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison As can be expected much of the crew of QUARTET has been retained for the second installment – though this also extends to at least three cast members namely Naunton Wayne Wilfrid HydeWhite and Felix Aylmer the last two had bit parts in the episode from QUARTET entitled “The Colonel’s Lady” While TRIO ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the runningtime it’s still done with the utmost care acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargainbr br “The Verger” tells of a church sexton James Hayter – for which the story’s title is another word – who’s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest Michael Hordern simply because he’s illiterate Rather than rest on his laurels despite his age he not only takes a wife his landlady played by Kathleen Harrison but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered – and with business flourishing this is developed into a whole chain The last scene then sees him pay a visit to bank manager Felix Aylmer who not only is surprised to learn of Hayter’s lack of education but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were – to which the wealthy and respected tobacconist replies with some measure of irony that he had the calling to be a verger br br The second episode “Mr KnowAll” is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man Nigel Patrick British despite his foreignsounding name of Kelada who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun Naunton Wayne and Wilfrid HydeWhite are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most – the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of Patrick’s attentions to his pretty wife Anne Crawford During a fancydress party however the passengers decide to enact their ‘revenge’ on Kelada by having one of them impersonate him a jest which he naturally doesn’t appreciate still it’s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character – told by Crawford that the necklace she’s wearing is an imitation Wayne challenges Patrick to name its price…but the latter realizes immediately that it’s the genuine article and that this would compromise Crawford’s position if he were to tell so Kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer br br As can also be deduced from the title “Sanatorium” deals with the myriad patients at such a place – run by Andre Morell the protagonist is a new intern Roland Culver who wistfully observes the various goingson The narrative in fact highlights in particular three separate strands of plot – one humorous the ‘feud’ between two aged Scots long resident at the sanatorium played by Finlay Currie and John Laurie one melodramatic the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient Raymond Huntley and longsuffering but devoted wife Betty Ann Davies and one bittersweet the romance between naïve but charming Jean Simmons and dashing cad Michael Rennie which in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that Morell has diagnosed Simmons as a ‘lifer’ while Rennie only has a few years left to him leads the couple to the altar
1	A beautiful postcard of New York The thing I enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear It never did My teenagers liked it too My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan My wife and I commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and ALL enjoy something This film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done The ending came with a twist which we all liked too If you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you As a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did I recommend it and we need more of these films to watch
1	Once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they somehow managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended youll find that its not half bad The plot is engaging and interesting and the pacing is fast with this covering many situations and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken Where this really stands out is the acting The performances are excellent Neill and Streep are both impeccable Its also cool to hear so much Australian spoken in a Hollywood film and even those who dont come naturally to it at least attempt an accent The cinematography and editing are nice enough but they dont really go beyond the standard stuff This movies story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling While I have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture I understand that it is quite close to the truth There is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this It is at times a downright great courtroom drama I recommend this to any fellow fan of such 710
1	I loved this film Not being a swooning Ed Wood Jr fan I prefer to appreciate his boundless enthusiasm and acknowledge his shortcomings His movies are fun but his personal story is one racked with pain I hoped and was delighted to find that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise From beginning to end this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to Ed Wood Jrbr br What we get are people who knew Ed Wood the best talking about him from all perspectives positive and negative and showing us their character as much as Eds We get insight into Eds personal and professional life from his romances to his drinking to his sexuality to his friends to his enemies and even to his film makingbr br The film itself is shot in a lowbudget way that seems done out of respect for Ed as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the President The set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their backgroundbr br Fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding Ed Wood controversies and new comers will be amazed that this man was real The DVD is full of impossible to find gems Crossroads of Lorado and photo galleries but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected storybr br Ed Wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him for better or worse to the point where one woman will go down in history as Swimming Pool Owner for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool This ability to define a persons legacy comes through universally as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was Ed Wood Jr but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created Somehow without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time the connection that Ed Wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear and the viewer is left with great sense of involvementbr br Even the title hints at the Blist horror genre but by the end we see that even this is a kindness What begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with Woods legendbr br In many ways a living contradiction Ed Wood Jr could not be condensed to a single viewpoint This collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get Being itself a juxtaposition of themes it is at once respectful provocative thoughtful gripping fun sad kind and fulfilling

1	This great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a DVD along with Prelude to War The great American filmmaker and story teller Frank Capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused World War II and Hitlers risebr br Every school child nay every American should watch these films today because they are so apropos History has been repeating itself over and over again The Lord Chamberlains are still alive and kicking the tactics used by the Nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the Communists and now by Muslim terrorist groups are still working to these evil groups advantagebr br By sitting back and letting Hitler as early as 1935 be aggressive France America and England caused over 50 million peoples deaths Americans French and British today would happily let Hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treatiesbr br These great films may be too simplistic for World War II history buffs They dont tell the horrors that the Soviet Union caused simply because at the time America was teamed up with them fighting Hitler This film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war
1	Passport to Pimlico is a real treat for all fans of British cinema Not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy but it is a cinematic flashback to a bygone age with attitudes and scenarios sadly now only a memory in British lifebr br Stanley Holloway plays Pimlico resident Arthur Pemberton who after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb discovers a wealth of medieval treasure belonging to the 14th Century Duke of Burgundy that has been buried deep underneath their little suburban street these last 600 yearsbr br Accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by King Edward IV of England which has never been officially rescinded to state that that particular London street had been declared Burgandian soil which means that in the eyes of international law Pemberton and the other local residents are no longer British subjects but natives of Burgundy and their tiny street an independent country in its own right and a law unto itselfbr br This sets the warbattered and impoverished residents up in good stead as they believe themselves to be outside of English law and jurisdiction so in an act of drunken defiance they burn their ration books destroy and ignore their clothing coupons flagrantly disregard British licencing laws etc declaring themselves fully independent from Britainbr br However what then happens is ever spiv black marketeer and dishonest crook follows suit and crosses the border into Burgundy as a refuge from the law and postwar restrictions to sell their dodgy goods and half of Londons consumers follow them in order to dodge the ration making their quiet happy little haven a den of thieves and a rather crowded one at thatbr br Appealing to Whitehall for assistance they are told that due to developments this is now a matter of foreign policy which His Majestys Government is reluctant to become involved which leaves the residents high and dry They do however declare the area a legal frontier and as such set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road mainly to monitor smuggling than to ensure any safety for the residents of Pimlicobr br Eventually the border is closed altogether starting a major siege with the Bugundian residents slowly running out of water and food but never the less fighting on in true British style As one Bugundian resident quotes were English and we always were English and its just because we are English we are fighting so hard to be Bugundians br br A sentiment that is soon echoed throughout the capital as when the rest of London learn of the poor Bugundians plight they all feel compelled to chip in and help them by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blockadesbr br Will Whitehall who has fought off so may invaders throughout the centuries finally be brought to its knees by this new batch of foreigners especially as these ones are English br br Great tale and great fun throughout Not to be missed
0	Shame on Yash Raj films and Aditya Chopra who seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and providing steady fare of tripe in this piece of cinematic crap thats not even worth You Tube standards I was gritting my teeth throughout the whole flick start to finish with the schizophrenic direction plot line that never quite materialized and on the last scene I just felt ashamed that my country and its crorepati film makers can THROW AWAY crores on such stupidity Shame on the actors for taking this work and even commenting on it as some piece of work they can own up to Saif Ali Khan completely disappointed in your choice of film Kareen shows enough skin for the puberty stricken and Akshay comes up as the dimwit Anil another retard with a pubescent fascination for English His cronies were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered in the last 15 minutes it was enough to pop a blood vessel DONT WASTe any brain cells energy or your money to go see this Go SEE Rent AMU with Konkana Sensharma instead a beautiful piece of independent film thats ever come out of IndiaIntelligent poignant and a wonderful storytale that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me hope that all is not lost in Indian cinema making

0	Disjointed unclear bad screenplay poor photography and directionall in all very obviously an illconceived first effort at commercial filmmaking by the good people at TBNbr br TBN Pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring China Cry the story of Nora Lam to the big screen But The Omega Code is an unfortunate miscue As a Christian who supports TBN and a lot of its programming and who loved China Cry I still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone They do much good with their ministry but this isnt an example of it Dont waste your moneygo rent China Cry instead
1	The beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mothers love the exceptional performances the steady execution and the quite innovative script The film tells the story of an Indian woman Nandini who lives in Canada with her husband Shekhar and little kid Raja All of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in India of whom she had not even known is in troubles and the couple rush to India When they get into the village Nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture Shekhars family ruled by his cruel highly cynical and merciless father Narasimha lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless Nandini starts nagging Shekhar to return home but he is soon killed by his fathers enemies When she wants to leave Narasimha refuses to let her take Raja back to India Here starts the intense struggle which can be called Nandini vs Narasimhabr br India is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas so it may be even correct The portrayal is in my view fair and not onesided because the positive side is also presented to an extent Such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world The locations are amazing the music is wonderful and Krishna Vamshis direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing One thing that must be noted is the very earpleasing background score by Ismail Darbar it is beautiful The characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film Portrayed realistically throughout the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch Its dialogues are superb and intelligently written and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tensionbr br The films biggest strength is the performances Karisma Kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as Nandini Her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible She displays so much intensity impulsiveness anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son Her outbreaks while facing off Nana Patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child After Fiza this is her most powerful performance One of the greatest actors Indian cinema has seen Nana Patekar is indescribable as Narasimha He manages to be hateful as Narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him Patekar displays cruelty wittiness and even humanity with total conviction He is outstanding Another great performance comes unsurprisingly from Indias most underrated actress Deepti Naval who sensitises her character to perfection Sanjay Kapoor is just adequate and Shahrukh Khan provides great comic relief Anyway do watch Shakti it could have been better but it is definitely a mustwatch

1	De Grot is a very good film The great plot comes from the novel by Tim Krabbé who also adapted this story for the screen Some really topclass acting not only by Van Huêt but especially by Marcel Hensema who mostly did TVwork prior to his performance of Axel van de Graaf The film seems to kick of as a thriller and sets an excellent mood Then we start to learn about Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flashback structure which adds to the more romantic aspect and the characterdriven drama of the movie In the end this all culminates into an emotional ending that will grab audiences by their throats Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie A mustsee especially if you liked Spoorloos The Vanishings original screen adaptation
0	he was my hero for all time until he went along with if you can call it a movie I went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my heros acting and the hole thing wasI cant believe that Steven Segals career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors I watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does When he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrongbr br The plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel youd be left wondering why you had even picked up the bookbr br Steven Segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation He shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesnt show up at allbr br I hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic The condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time The zappruder film showing President John F Kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleanerbr br My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds I read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget Segal being paid 5 of that and that the movie still came in under budget I must concurbr br It is no wonder that this is a direct to DVD movie as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie

1	De Grot is a terrific Dutch thriller based on the book written by Tim Krabbé Another of his books Het Gouden Ei was made into the great Dutch mystery thriller called Spoorloos The Vanishing in 1988 This one is not as good as that thriller although much better than the American remake also called The Vanishing but there are times it comes closebr br Especially the opening moments are terrific We see a man later we learn his name is Egon Wagter Fedja van Huêt coming from a plane in Thailand When he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border These scenes are perfectly directed photographed and acted A kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this Later we see how Egon makes his deal in Thailand with a woman both stating that they have never done anything like thisbr br From this point the movie is constantly flashback and flashforward We see how Egon still as a child here played by Erik van der Horst befriends a guy named Axel as a kid played by Benja Bruijning We learn how they grew up as friends sort of and how Axel as an adult played by Marcel Hensema became a criminal Egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman Around this time he sometimes meets Axel but does not really want anything to do with himbr br The movie is chronological in a way It shows Egon and Axel as kids than as students young adults and in their midthirties But from time to time like I said the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again Every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adultsbr br Minor spoilers hereinbr br The title means The Cave and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending although it is in fact not that happy Like the beginning the ending is terrific The middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes only to come back at that point in the end It is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well
1	A lot of people unfairly sht on this series but several of the Guinea Pig videos are fairly entertaining Devils Experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects worknot just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realisticespecially for the videos vintage and lowbudgetbr br Let me start at the beginning now for those who dont know This film is an extreme torturefake snuff film that surfaced in Japan in the mid80s Its plot as it stands is simple A young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is This entails brutal violenceall effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girls arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky woundbr br The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground These two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedingsbr br The actress who plays the victim of the experiment is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera Her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling Some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest Also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels till she pukesbr br If you havent seen this series I hope I have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot 8510 for Devils Experiment
0	Horror fans Im speaking to the over 12s although if youre under 12 I apologise for what you might deem an insult In short if you appreciate having your imagination disturbed by well written original storytelling punctuated by unpredictable well planted scares and delivered via convincing performances then I can heartily recommend AVOIDING THESE STEAMERS made by directors who have apparently long since past their sell by date Its no accident that almost every episode feels as if it were made in the 1980s Not to put blame squarely on the shoulders of some of these old boys or indeed the 80s because where would we be without certain movies from the likes of Argento Carpenter Landis Dante and Barker Actually Clive WTF are you doing in there Glad to see Romero had the good sense to give it a miss as Im sure he was asked to partake More perhaps we should point the finger at creator Mick Garris whose credentials include the logic defying and depressingly illadvised TV remake of Stanley Kubricks masterpiece The Shiningbr br Perhaps it is an indication of the state of television today Are we so starved of good TV horror that we applaud any old sloppy schlock that the networks excrete onto our sets Sadly maybe sobr br Normally I wouldnt see the point of adding a comment that doesnt argue the faults and merits of a production Id just rate it accordingly However as this series is woefully lacking in any merit with perhaps the sole exception of the theme tune I write this as more of a warning than a review DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY If you disagree with me then its more than likely that you havent seen enough decent horror Perhaps the earlier films of some of these directors would be a much better place to start but if these Masters of Horror were being assessed on these works alone theyd never have been allowed to graduate with even their Bachelors degree Unless of course they were studying for a degree from the University Of St
1	This is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the Cameroon The sisters in law are female lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a Muslim council It is rather long about two hours but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiffs and defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges It will leave you as it left me with many questions about exactly how this change occurred How and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the Cameroon Have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses Was the granting of a divorce by a Muslim court against the express wishes of the husband a one time event Im not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions They made the movie two years ago not yesterday And the movie they made deserves a wide audience
1	I remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the Lifetime TV network and thought it was an interesting story Several years later I see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie The story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself The cast just makes it that much more appealing Meryl Streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture She nails Mrs Chamberlains mannerisms the accent and even look She shows the pain hurt surprise and anger that Lindy had to endure and in the process its hard to remember that it ISNT Lindy In my opinion this performance of Meryls was better than her Oscarwinning turn in Sophies Choice and should have garnered her her third Oscar Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain and for some surprising reason wasnt recognized by the Academy with at least a nomination In all this movie only receive ONE Oscar nod Streeps for Best Actress However it did receive several Australian Oscars and nominationsbr br Definitely a toprate movie it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast

1	The United States of Kiss My Assbr br House of Games is the directional debut from playwright David Mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller It stars Lindsay Crouse as bestselling psychiatrist Margaret Ford who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide In doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels downtown to visit the lowlife place House of Gamesbr br The gambler Mike played excellently by Joe Mantegna turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty He offers Crouses character a deal if she is willing to sit with him at a game a big money game in the backroom hell cancel the patients debts The card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work gaining the trust of others and a fascinating relationship begins What makes House of Games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control is it the psychiatrist or the conman or is it the wellknown man of great bluffs David Mametbr br In House of Games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring however in every David Mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings not the direction In House of Games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads showy and distracting but mainly as is the case with much of Mamets work it is the dialogue which grips you and slowly draws you into the film No one in the House of Games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words Everyone bluffs and double bluffs which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order This is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension House of Games can also be viewed as a classwar division movie With Lindsay Crouse we have the middleclass welltodo educated psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the complete opposite the working class of America earning a living by honest crimebr br The film seduces the viewer much like Crouse is seduced by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema And the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for its stunningbr br An extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings 910

1	A genuine screaming situation comedy farce of the mid 70s this film was a HUGE hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared off the face of the earth I am constantly amazed at some comedy films that are a big release one week and then vanish HIGH ANXIETY THE CHEAP DETECTIVE THE BLACK BIRD DONT LOOK NOW WERE BEING SHOT AT and have no profile at all today NORMAN was the comedy of the month in whenever 1976 and everyone seemed to see it laugh about it and then never ever mention it ever again Famous for being shot on videotape and transferred to film an experiment at the time NORMAN is a raucous politically incorrect closet slamming farce that The Farrelly Brothers should look at remaking today If they had made it in the first place there would be no complaints about its content and slant either It is very funny and YES very rude and hilariously all wrong Just as it should be In fact as a groovy 1976 film with all those horror colours and clothes it actually works better today
0	I give this a generous four out of ten stars or dots or markers or somethingbr br There were a grand total of two really really funny scenes in this movie All the scenes with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear Greg Kinnear moved along agreeably enoughbr br Otherwise the usual trafficking in stereotypes blazing speed rudely pushed along by a stupid soundtrack and soundtrack is generous br br Anyway the two really really funny scenes involved Amy P Shes just really hilarious in an animal kind of way Shes a mixture of that ape man skit that they do on SNL and Lucille Ballbr br I hope they Amy P and Tina Fey just flat out admitted they did this for the money because if by doing it it gave birth to the Sarah Palin parodies then I guess we can say yeah it was worth it to put the black guy back into the servant man role whos really there to help you be more humanbr br Blah 4 outta 10 like I said is generousbr br But no more girls OK Oh I almost forgot The mom from Two and a Half Men is in this movie and shes had some kind of plastic surgery so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a 30 year old so every scene shes in Im like trying to rearrange her face or put it together in my mind or just answer the question No Wait Wait HAS she had plastic surgery Because as a viewer you really dont want her to have had plastic surgery

0	I first heard of Unisol 2 when I drove past a cinema when I was on holiday in America I really did not take much notice of it until I bought the original on DVD which led me to find out about its three sequels I subsequently started to read about The Return on the IMDB and asked friends what they thought of it Despite their horrific criticisms of it I still went out of my way to see it and was on the brink of buying it until I saw it for hire on DVD I wasnt expecting much but thought that it must have been half decent to get a theatrical release in the US after all how often is it that you see Van Damme on the big screen Well nothing could have prepared me for this It is so bad I almost cried What a total waste of 80 minutes and £250 It is hard to explain how bad this move is Honestly This is idiotic film making No its more than idiotic I just cannot believe how this got made I cannot believe that someone out there has not murdered Mic Rogers How stupid can people possibly be firstly Van Damme actually thinking the script and finished film was good Secondly the fact that Xander Berkley of Terminator 2 and Air Force One status commited himself to this film I simply cannot believe the stupidity of this movie It takes itself so seriously but comes across to the audience like a spoof Here is an example JCVDs daughter yes Luc is now a human again I want my Daddy SETH So do I Oh yeah and some guy tries to shut down SETH by pulling three huge levers with wait for it ON and OFF written on them The acting all round is like playschool acting Im sure Mr Director modelled Lucs reporter girlfriend on April ONeil from the cartoon Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles she refuses to go because she needs her story I mean come on how many cliches can a film possibly use Please listen to me fellow IMDB users dont touch this with a barge pole To conclude Universal Soldier The Return has no relation whatsoever to the first movie In fact if they werent called UniSols then you would never know it was a sequel Luc is now a human again what the hell The only place in which he can access the internet is in a stripclub All the new Uni Sols look like they were dragged off the street they are that unconvincing This is pure torture to watch so do yourself a favour dont torture yourself PS Best part of the movie Romeo jumps off a building and shouts Oh sht
1	The unlikely duo of Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte team up to give us some interesting performances and subject matter in The Angel Levine Its one interesting twist on the themes from Its A Wonderful Lifebr br Zero is married to Ida Kaminsky and the two of them belong to a special class of elderly Jewish poor in New York Mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his trade but his back and arthritis have prevented him from working Kaminsky is mostly bedridden Hes reduced to applying for welfare In desperation like Jimmy Stewart he cries out to God for some helpbr br Now maybe if he had gotten someone like Henry Travers things might have worked out differently but even Stewart had trouble accepting Travers But Travers had one thing going for him he was over 100 years off this mortal coil and all his ties to earthly things were gone God sent Mostel something quite different the recently deceased Harry Belafonte who should have at least been given some basic training for angels before being given an assignmentbr br Belafonte hasnt accepted hes moved on from life hes still got a lot of issues He also has a wife Gloria Foster who doesnt know hes passed on hit by a car right at the beginning of the film You put his issues and Mostels issues and youve got a good conflict starting with the fact that Mostel cant believe in a black Jew named Levinebr br This was the farewell performance for PolishJewish actress Ida Kaminsky who got a nomination for Best Actress in The Shop on Main Street a few years back The other prominent role here is that of Irish actor Milo OShea playing a nice Jewish doctor Remembering OSheas brogue from The Verdict I was really surprised to see and hear him carry off the part of the doctorbr br The Angel Levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society Its brought to you by a stellar cast and of course created by acclaimed writer Bernard Malamud Make sure to catch it when broadcast
1	Tim Krabbe is the praised author of Het Gouden Ei a novel that was put on the screen twice Spoorloos and The Vanishing One of the Dutch writers more recent works is De Grot a psychological thriller about two totally different men Egon and Axel who meet at a youth camp and surprising enough become friends for dear life Egon is a quiet somewhat dull person who spends his time studying and writing geography books Axel on the other hand is a charismatic partyanimal a heavy drinking criminal whose everydays concern is to get a woman into his bedroom From the moment they meet Axel has a strong influence on Egon while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything such as reading thick books like Egon ultimately Egon is even dragged by Egon into illegal practices himself which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant Asian countrybr br After having read the book last year I was surprised the critics were quite positive about it In my opinion the book suffers especially from the complex structure While Krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people the plot becomes more of a puzzle the many episodes are not presented chronologically so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode Because of this the story feels surprisingly remote you often need to know a characters background to really care for him or her Another complaint was the fact that the main characters Egon and Axel are a little stereotypical Egon IS the dull intellectual while Axel IS his exact opposite In real life such onedimensional people rarely exist in books and films they always seem to be there taking away a lot of credibilitybr br Despite all this the film was a pleasant surprise being much better than the book The adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography humour and acting Fedja van Huet Egon is one of the few Dutch actors who can make you forget he IS acting which is in my opinion the highest an actor can achieve The drawbacks of the film however are the same as the books mainly because the characters are onedimensional they are so predictable that it becomes annoying Guess who wrote the script Indeed Krabbe himself It is obvious that this talented director thats what the movie makes clear anyway is hampered by a deficient screenplay Perhaps Koolhoven should just have chosen a better bookbr br 710
0	I cant think of much to say about this film br br This was an awful movieI cant even tell you what made me decide to view it It had SO few redeeming qualities that I dont even know where to beginbr br The plot moved from implausible to downright absurd My entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because I could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done By the end of the movie I found myself feeling beyond relieved br br The editing was poor the acting was subpar and the storyline was weak Francoise Robinson was cast as a Native American even though she does not even closely resemble someone of Native American heritage br br If a movie is going to be this idiotic it should be laughably stupid at the very least It wasnt It was just pathetic
1	This is one of the best episode from the second season of MOH I think Mick Garris has a problem with women He killem all they are often the victims Screwfly solution Prolife Valerie on the stairs I dont remember the Argentos episode in season 1 etc obviously Imprint I think he enjoys to watch women been burn torture mutilated and I dont know Never least Right to die is one of the best with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense specially with the photos from the cell scene wonderful The acting is like the entire series regular I could be worst like Prolife or We scream for Ice cream Also I think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode The ideology of the series is horrible killing and terminating women mutilating animals and on and on the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like Cigarrette burns The best of all Homecoming The most funny Imprint really shocking

0	Raising Victor Vargas is one of those light family movies that you can watch and do the NY Times crossword puzzle at the same time And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a Corona you dont have to Pause the DVD Just let it roll cause you wont be missing anything really important No twists turns or tension Its not really an ethnic movie its a movie about a poor struggling immigrant family that happens to be Latino They could have been any ethnic group It made very little difference Ive seen it all a zillion times before Just plug in a Jewish family an Italian family a Black family or an Irish family Just the accents and names were different If the Vargas family was named Bush or Clinton and were Presbyterians the movie would have been a total snooze br br Its funny that the critics here couldnt get the locale straight Some said it was Spanish Harlem Some the Bronx and another Brooklyn As a lifelong New Yorker I vote for the Lower East Side And it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other Latinos They lived in an insulatedisolated little enclave Some interaction with nonLatinos might have created some excitement interest or tension Remember West Side Storybr br And now for the oftcriticized cinematography I dont know if it was my TV or what but all the indoor shots looked very ORANGE to me The apt the furniture and the faces were all ORANGE What was that supposed to mean And the apt did look pretty cramped to me Somebody here mentioned that the old aptstenements had very big rooms Well maybe 50 years ago What landlords have done is to break up one big apt into 2 or 3 very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them br br And another annoying thing This is the second family movie Ive seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy jerking off Is this private sex act necessary for us to watch Please spare me Whats up with these directors br br So Victor Vargas is a pleasant little movie It was nice for a change to see young Latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents which they did But the writers let them down giving them a flat unspectacular script to work with Enjoy the show but keep your fingers near the fast forward button
0	This movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together Well theres nothing wrong with that except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together 90 percent of the cast are white males about same age Its almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves The movie has no plot It simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath There are some funny scenes and comedic bits But they dont redeem the flat monotonybr br The graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do and not done very well at that Anything that cant be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animationbr br I went to see this film after seeing the trailer which makes it look like a Tarrentino piece Well the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get Ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane inane comedy It works at times but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over Its more like a string of Satuday Night Live skits than a movie Its a hityouovertheheadwithit kind of comedy I can see where the story idea is intriguing But in this film post apocalyptic America is much like Medevil England In fact Wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era He plans to make a Part 2 I guess he thinks hes Tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thingbr br At the opening in LA Wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part 2 He was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one to which he replied well yea sure
1	Watch on the Rhine is one of the best antinazi propaganda films made during World War Two Paul Lukas was certainly deserving of his Oscar Bette Davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was I would recommend this film to those interested in that era and of course the fabulous films of the late great Ms Bette Davis
0	A difficult film to categorize I was never giving it 110 concentration consequently as simple as the plot appeared I couldnt say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the American FBI characters what their roles were Nor could I take the Irwins seriously as film characters when their lines scenes were all in the style of one of his shows not acted outbr br This is nothing more than a glorified episode of a Discovery TV show with a largely insignificant sub plot going on which just seemed to get in the way However as any Irwin show is always worth a watch this film is well worth a look too but not on Christmas Day Talking of which Ive better things to do too than be on herebr br A high 410
1	In watching this early DeMille work it was once again reinforced to me that early DeMille is far superior to late DeMille His attention to use of light within scenes is remarkable His pacing is very good enabling much to be told in the space of an hour or so It is a pity that he wasnt as intuitive about the style of his later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent filmsbr br This was the first film in which I had seen Cleo Ridgely She was remarkable quite restrained and yet conveyed a broad spectrum of emotionsbr br The ending is wonderful
1	I was one of many that expected to see a glorified Yankeedoodle dandy portrayal of a day that as famously quoted should live in infamy rather than glory How wrong I was These guys were there right in the middle of it and the pictures they returned are both amazing and heartbreaking And yet it all occurred on a chance trip to the world trade centre on September 11 2001br br Two French filmmakers were compiling a documentary about life as a NY firefighter particularly from the perspective of a young rookie coming up through the ranks At the beginning we see much of this footage just to remind us that there was no thought to producing a film about terrorism This was intended to be a film about regular people earning an honest living helping others and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this edgebr br While investigating a suspect gas line I think my memorys a little hazy on that we suddenly hear a plane fly overhead The camera pans up to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing itself into one of the towers What must the cameraman have been thinking at this time Recognising the importance of the footage the camera stays on and possibly realizing the same thing the FDNY allow the camera to follow them into the buildingbr br What follows is a true view from the frontlines We see the commitment of the FDNY their reactions the stunned silence after hearing the first person fall to their death is chilling as well as the collapse of the one of the buildings from the inside while a second camera captures the events from the outsidebr br If it wasnt for the horrific event they were covering the footage alone would be any young docomakers dream come true Quite simply the footage deserves to be preserved for all time But what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer We see firefighters charging in without hesitation people of different races helping one another escape to wave of rubble and even the concern of the filmmakers for one another they are brothers as they cannot reach one another in the confusion There are amazing sights as well as amazing human stories in this film something Hollywood could never duplicate even though its tryingbr br 911 isnt a film about politics Nor is it a film about religion nationality or even jihad for that matter 911 is a film about people and a true indication of the best and worst that we are capable of 911 is quite simply one of the most important films Ive ever seen and would be the only film to be born from this event if it were up to me You cant duplicate this
0	I figured that its about time I let this one out Pokémon fans are suffering in America these days Why Because we rely on Kids WB and 4Kids Entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies As far as the series goes they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the Japanese versions to television So what is their problem when it comes to the movies Honestly now I have seen all three Pokémon movies in Japanese and I will definitely be seeing the fourth one They are excellent movies They are all enjoyable and fun to watch And after seeing Pokémon 2000 in theaters I cant help but wonder how these American producers read the Japanese scripts The way it appears it seems that they read and see something that says Insert empty moral here in big bold faced letters It definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on MSB extreme sarcasm there and created this crapbr br possible spoilers from here onbr br Well I guess I should first talk about Pikachus Rescue Adventure My first gripe with this came with no narration I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pokédex narration that plagued Pikachus Vacation and instead of going with a caring gentle womans voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai they just cut the narration all together This wouldnt have been a problem except for one thing Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute didnt let Togepi go until the end Possibly the fans but Im sure not the parents Then theres the theme song I couldnt help but roll my eyes at this one The Japanese theme song was Tankentai wo Tsukurou and was sung by Japanese children It was fun and enjoyable This one nauseating Now one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana Nice music fun to watch Thats changed with the Bellossom The music sucked for one but on top of that they had all the Pokémon talk during the music which turned out to be jumpy annoying and just unnecessary Oh and then theres the Poliwhirl who thinks hes a Poliwrath Youd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are Basically not much could save this little ill fated dub which is very unfortunate considering its potential But I havent touched on the worst of it yetbr br Youd think that the warning signs wouldve been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power For some unfathomable reason I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB My thoughts were well they screwed up on the first movie but the second is different as far as the theme goes so they should do well That in mind I just didnt pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said You will believe that one person can make all the difference With the way they said that at every turn I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version Then comes Nintendo Power in which I see all my fears realized in the words the main feature The Power of One At that point I became a bit more uneasy The Power of One Not a good sign However I still kept some of my false faith Big mistakebr br Sitting in the theater I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle I can see a point in that since they didnt pander this thing repeating it over and over like in MSB However it did more damage than anything else in this movie First of all the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read the world turns to Ash Ah hah So Ash is the chosen one Whatever In the Japanese version the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pokémon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony This time hes the chosen one A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pokémon movie when the movie was ABOUT Lugia In this one Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash In the scene where theyre flying back to the main island Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugias existence not that Ash is going to make all the difference Overall in this category Ash wasnt really the one person that would make the difference since he was helped by many along the waybr br A lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking Fururas flute song wasnt nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one Jirarudans speech to them saying his collection started with a Mew card Ugh Even worse Mistys outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held Why didnt you put them in Pokéballs when you caught them This is like caging them to be displayed Much different from whining about him thinking Pokémon are things to be collected like stamps If there were any real redeeming values in this they came from Team Rocket Some pretty funny lines Not really to make me laugh out loud but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach Well that was officially the last American Pokémon movie Im going to see Ive imported the third one and find it very enjoyable I would rather not see another Japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two Ill be importing the fourth one as well Forget you Kids WB and 4Kids You have forsaken me for the last time
0	From its uninspiring title to the flat acting performances Curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout The film has gained some fans by way of the fact that Quentin Tarantinos name is attached to it and the silly and out of place nod to the RodriguezTarantino flick From Dusk till Dawn These things do not make a great movie however and this is more than evident all the way through Curdled The film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing The Mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool but its becomes annoying very quickly especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is Mexican it doesnt fit with the tone of the movie The films plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who because of her obsession with grisly murders takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes It sounds boring and it isbr br William Baldwin is the only name on the cast list and even he doesnt make an impression He hasnt been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing hes pretty much wasted Angela Jones or rather the taxi driver from Pulp Fiction takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman and it is always clear that its her involvement with Pulp Fiction that won her this role not her acting ability She may have been good enough in her small role in Tarantinos masterpiece but she doesnt have the talent to lead a film by herself She looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film and if it werent for her Latino accent she wouldnt convince the audience that shes a weirdo on any level Curdled is a one hundred percentproof piece of forgettable trash Films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics but this one fails on all levels Whether youre a Tarantino fan William Baldwin fan horror fan or just a movie buff this is one to miss
0	Man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy Now most of the rest of the film was okay It had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing Yes Alderich is a great director who made FLight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane among others The problem isnt with direction acting or anything technical The movie is just destroyed in the third act Why The murders twists turns and characters have all been revolving around NUCLEAR MATERIAL What the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that The way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest Deus Ex Machina in history For all the complaints about Burtons Planet of the Apes THe life of David Gale or Notorious I think THIS is the worst ending ever What a let down
0	These were over 80 minutes of semi unexpected boredom First I was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that Then reaching 70th minute I was convincing myself that its only a few more minutes and I lasted to the very end which Im kinda proud of as I consider watching this movie as a great test for humans patience and crap tolerance Was it worth watching at all Well as I wrote above if you want to test yourself give it a try and if youre strong willed enough you may even last to the end The movie lacks coherence and characters seem to have no common sense at all All happenings in the movie you can be sure you saw somewhere before and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film reel
1	Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums and of course they have to be Mexican obviously his good will towards his fellow man backfires In that case it wasnt too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums but I like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldnt be ignored Im reminded of the episode of Michael Moores brilliant The Awful Truth when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay The results were not very promising so its nice to see someone in the movies setting a good examplebr br Jim Carrey plays the part of Bruce Nolan the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart Or even better it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere a little metaphor that comes up when Bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film Bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery thats seeking to bake the worlds biggest cookie Hes desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the TV station but he loses his cool on live TV when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report Needless to say he loses his temper on live TV in one of the funniest scenes of the entire filmbr br Morgan Freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the Man himself displaying a God whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through Freemans massive talent as an actor He is the kind of God who takes his job very seriously but in such a way as to advise his followers as well as the viewers of this movie that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life I love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day There are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in America who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humansbr br One of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewers religion I for example tend to reject organized religion in all forms and I see God and Satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live But despite the fact that I dont believe that God exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time I was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this moviebr br Jim Carreys movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far hes come If you compare Bruce Almighty with movies like Ace Ventura both of which I loved by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film its amazing how far hes come He has moved from cheesy TV comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like The Truman Show Man on the Moon and The Majestic easily one of his greatest films ever Jim Carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working todaybr br Jennifer Aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the sidesplitting Office Space as Bruces girlfriend who becomes increasingly exasperated by Bruces growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him There is definitely some lowbrow comedy in the film that doesnt really fit with the importance of the films meaning or the quality of the delivery such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene but it was definitely pretty nice to see Ace Venturas friend Spike make a cameo appearance As Stephen King very well knows its always nice to see familiar characters Its almost like seeing family againbr br Bruce is endowed with the powers of God for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him The thing I love about this is that like I said before religion is absent from my life but I was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things I would have done had I been endowed with such powers The movie allows us to learn vicariously this way which empowers the message even morebr br The scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film such as the scene when Bruce loses his temper about the anchor position the Jimmy Hoffa scene who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records the scene where Bruces rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera and my favorites the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakerys cooking The movie has plenty of time for Carrey to deliver some excellent jokes such as when he says to God who reveals that hes the janitor the proprietor the electrician etc that his Christmas parties must be real bashes and to be careful about drinking because on of him might need a ride home I also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes A little too true and as Gallagher would add behind every great man is also an amazed motherinlawbr br Bruce Almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while and is probably the only directly religious that I can remember seeing that I am anxious to buy on DVD to add to my personal collection It is a comedy written and performed in good taste but with enough relatively lowbrow humor to keep the kids entertained This is a meaningful comedy for the whole family which is becoming rarer and rarer these days In a world that is about to be flogged with yet another American Pie film AND another Scary Movie which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy its nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching Dont miss this one
1	The Haunted World of Edward D Wood Jr isnt a particularly good documentary Aesthetically its lackluster and cheap looking the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and incohesive but this adds to its charm I say this because its a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and as such theres really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits There are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of Wood and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary Overall its worth a watch for the Wood fan and those of cinema in general but dont expect brilliance here Expect a documentary made after Woods own heart
0	Three Daring Daughters is a sickly sweet rosecolored look at divorce remarriage and singleparent living Obviously social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted takes a cruise and then dates and marries a band conductor Even when the its just a movie phrase excuses the script from addressing reallife problems Daughters suffers from too many incoherent highnote songs children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader Hose Iturbi playing himself Isnt it bizarre that any real person would star in a film in which their supposed real self gets married br br Admittedly this movie was released in the nineteen forties Only a love for old style Hollywood romance and comedy could make Daughters a tolerable film
1	Tweaked a little bit Nothing could be a childrens film Its a very clever concept touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes and goes against pretty much every Hollywood convention you can think ofwhat goes against everything more than literally nothing Nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives All thats left is what they dont hate and a big empty white space Its hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot It focuses on pretty much one subject but thats prime Vincenzo Natali territory If youve seen Cube you know already that he tends to like that type of situation The nothing in this movie is apparently infinite space but Natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic if only because theres literally nothing else and nowhere else to go The actors sell it although you can tell these guys are friends anyway Two actors from Cube return here Worth and Kazan but are entirely different characters They change throughout the story and while theyre not the strongest actors in the world theyre at least believablebr br The reason I say this could be a childrens film under the right tweaks is because aside from a few fbombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids So I find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore especially considering there isnt very much of it This couldve gotten a PG rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue There is very little objectionable about this film but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it I only say thats a shame because not because I support censorship but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposurebr br At any rate this is a reasonably entertaining film albeit with a few draggedout scenes But for literally being about nothing and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film
1	I believe they were telling the truth the whole timeU cant trust anything in the wild They family went through hellThose poor boys too young to understand what was going on around them But still having to deal with the rumours As well as dealing with the lose of their little sister I cant believe this case went on for so longseems like the jury couldnt see the truth even if it bit them on the assI feel for this family and if i could let them know i hate what has happened to them i wouldI have no idea what they went through i cant even imagine it After watching this movie i was in tears and had to check on my little girl in bedI think everyone should watch this
1	A sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings The excop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting even though they are marrying other people Maybe a little trite in that the partners are both type A personalities while our protagonists are much more relaxed Not anything heavy but it made me smile And hey for the guys sell the Natasha Henstridge angle and the gals sell them the sappy romance everyone wins
1	An unexpected pleasure as I had heard nothing about this filmbr br Shameful since it warrants having a wider audiencebr br A wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told although admittedly predictable in its resolution Solidly acted by the principals Beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the filmbr br My recent foray into Chinese film Shower The Road Home Not One Less has been an exciting one that I hope to continue exploring China and its people is an amazing canvas for filmmakers The King of Masks can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent Chinese filmbr br
1	One of the great things about many of the superb Chinese movies you can find if you are lucky in the video stores is they are very accurate retellings of actual true stories Farewell my Concubine The Emperor and the Assassin and this movie are perfect examples The film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience the hallmark of much Hollywood and especially Disney filmsbr br In this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the King of Masks for his mastery of Sichuan Change Art Along an having lost his only son many years earlier he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader All is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art But the son eventually is found out to be a girl From there the story get very interesting with a good performance by Master Liang of the Sichuan Opera a regional operatic style related to Peking Opera Fans of Farewell My Concubine should look carefully at Master Liangs portrayal of a male playing the female role in Chinese Opera It may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality
0	Madison is not too badif you like simplistic nonoffensive familyfriendly fare and more importantly if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing If like me you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like Musson Muncey Cantrell Slovak etc prepare to be disappointedbr br Professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports cliché in the book I neednt repeat what theyve said What I felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the glory years which many would argue were already past in 1971br br Yes it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast though it was clear that the restored versions hats off to the volunteers at the Hydroplane and Race Boat Museum were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed But where was the sound Much of the thrill of the old hydros was the mindnumbing roar of six Allison or RollsMerlin aircraft engines wound up to RPMs never imagined by their designers hitting the starting line right in front of you You didnt hear it you FELT it Real hydro buffs know exactly what Im talking about Theres none of that in Madison Instead every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a heroic musical scorebr br And then there are the closeup shots of the drivers riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor hometown hero Or in one particularly ridiculous shot taking time to spot Jake Lloyd giving a Rocky salute from a bridge pier In reality some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rockhard water at speeds above 150 mphbr br As one reviewer so aptly put it The sport deserves better than thisbr br Finally since another user brought up anachronisms Ill add one the establishing shot of Seattle shows the Kingdome and Safeco Field Neither existed in 1971
0	Usually Im a bit of a fan of the bad eighties early nineties film featuring now has beensbut this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through Guys dressing up as girls has been done to death but never so pathetically Corey Haims performance was abysmal as usual Nicole Eggert was not much better This has no redeeming qualities even if you are a number 1 fan of an actoractress in this piece of trash stay away
0	This film wasnt programmed in Italian cinemasI have seen it at a manifestation called fantafestivalI find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and theres no suspence in the film Music is completely out of the story and I dont have words to describe the visual effectsIf you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting but a few minutes later it becomes busyThe story is interesting but the development needs a complete review
1	I first saw this movie when I was a little kid and fell in love with it at once The sets are breath taking and some of the script is damn right hilarious You sons of a thousand fleasbr br It is always shown on TV late at night or really early in the morning i woke up at about 300 am once and it had just started TV companys need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time Sunday so everyone can get a chance to view this fine workbr br 1010
0	Someone actually gave this movie 2 stars Theres a very high chance they need immediate professional help as anyone who doesnt spend 30 seconds to see if you can award no stars is quite literally scarybr br This film is well I guess its pretty much some kind of attempt at a horrible porn snuff movie with no porn or no real horrible bits apart from the acting plot story sets dialogue and sound I wrongly assumed it was about zombies br br Watching it is actually quite scary in fairness youre terrified someone will come over and youll never be able to describe what it is and theyll go away thinking youre a freak that watches homemade amateur torture videos or something along those lines br br Im so taken aback Im writing this review on my mobile so I dont forget to attempt to bring the rating down further than the current 16 to save others from the same horrible fate that I just suffered br br I worst film Ive ever seen and I can say with hand on heart it will never never be topped
1	This isnt as violent as I was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effectivebr br There are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know whos side a particular character is onbr br The plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the Triad gang it followsbr br The violence when it comes is brutal no guns or martial art scenes with special effects this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the Triad is a violent criminal organisationbr br The ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable
0	I checked this movie out based on a favorable review on this page It is slow moving and the payoff is a four star dudThe only mystery here is how Oscar® winner F Murray Abraham got involved with such a lousy script
0	Although I had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie this sure as hell wasnt what I would have had in mind had anything actually come to mind Once I heard of its existence all I knew was that I had to own a movie called Please Dont Eat The Babies unfortunately I could only find a copy under its alternate title Island Fury Looking back I guess I could call it a loselose situation On one hand I still dont get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called Please Dont Eat The Babies and on the other hand Island Fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful pointless boring unwatchable piece of garbage Yeah definitely loselosebr br Im not even sure what genre theyre going for here Just early 80s badness with a flashback that might actually be longer than the nonflashback First up two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys once caught the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string around her neck and somehow these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere And this is where things start to get weird somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island years earlier when they were only 10 I guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is So now were in the past while the girls try to retrace their steps so these bad guys dont kill them although I wouldnt have minded if they had In the flashback the 10 year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends eventually stopping by an island for some air they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents Any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up but the flashback was undeniably better than the present which still isnt saying muchbr br For a while there I had forgotten about the original story At one point I Ithought maybe the director had too and when the flashback ended that would be the end which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a halfhour shorter This pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end and real stuff does happen but its stupid I guess I didnt exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured or anything like that but I did expect some form of outlandish Bentertainment mostly just a confusing inept storyline unsure of its genre My advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like Attack Of The Beast Creatures If anyone I would only recommend this one to serious Bmovie collectors who must have them all anyone else interested probably has brain damage What really gets me is that I still have no idea why they called it Please Dont Eat The Babies 310
1	I turned this on to see the incredible Ethel Waters whose autobiography I am now reading Ill admit my jaw dropped when the pork chops and watermelon references started rolling in but people cannot look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece Its pretty much a short film made by blacks for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite segregated and the stereotypes to the people involved were the jokes of their time old trends exaggerated for humor We see modern black movies do the same thing but with the new trends stereotypes hos and the hood and such I think if you look back in eighty years you would find todays movies will look just as racist What viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of Waters and the pintsized Sammy Davis Jr who out taps his contemporary Shirley Temple and looks remarkably the same facially as he did as an adult Everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it Why not enjoy it for what it is instead of what you think it should have been
0	There seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to critique its methodology which is extremely flawed It simply continues to propogate journalistic style analysis which is that it plays off of the audiences lack of knowledge and prejudice in order to evoke an emotional decry and outburst of negative diatribebr br Journalism 101 tell the viewer some fact only in order to predispose them into drawing conclusions which are predictable for instance the idea of civil war chaos looting etc were all supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of governmental infrastructure following Husseins demise were these not all symptomatic of an already destitute culture doctrinal infighting as symptomatic of these veins of Islam itself rather than a failure in police force to restrain and secure would they rather the US have declared marshall law im sure the papers here wouldve exploded with accusations of a police state and fascist forcebr br aside from the analytical idiocy of the film it takes a few sideliners and leaves the rest out claiming soandso refused to be interviewed yet the questions they wouldve asked are no doubt already answered by the hundred inquisitions those individuals have already received would you as vice president deign to be interviewed by a first time writerproducer which was most certainly already amped to twist your words they couldnt roll tape of Condi to actually show her opinion and answer some of the logistics of the questions perhaps they never watched her hearingbr br this is far from a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there this is another biased asinine approach by journalists which are by and large unthinking herdsbr br anyone wanting to comment on war ought at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than NBC coverage and CNN commentary these interpretations smack of the same vitriol which simply creates a further bipartisanism of those who want to think and those who want to be told by the media what to think
1	Looking back over the past 28 years since my first exposure to the show all i can say is Once you get itit will stay with you forever I remember my initial reaction being 1 annoyingly overacted 2under produced 3 unlikeable charactersbr br Well two years later I watched some episodes again and didnt find it nearly as annoying A year later I was able to catch the entire series from the beginning and quickly became engrossed in its bittersweet tale of human fault and perspectives on happiness Yes the show has a style that is not for everybody and Im sure the dated production value would be hard to deal with now But I still think about the show at least once a month with a vague teary eyed longing for what seemed like simpler times br br BTW I am a married manfor all who think this is a show for females
0	Firstly I am not easily scared by Anything except for my few phobias but this movie is absolutely horrific This is not appropriate for children at all I had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me I Couldnt believe how gory it was for a childrens movie bunnies being brutally murdered Its just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated G I recommend being over 8 to see this But dont get me wrong it was probably a good movie if I wasnt scarred mentally as a child I cannot believe a parent would allow a lets say 4 year old child to watch this Its just to intense and complicated not to forget gory for young kids Im wayy over 4 and I was shocked by the violence I dont recommend
1	definitely needed a little work in season 2 Such as the Virus between Max and Logan and Ames White along with his ancient super cult During season two however the only thing that kept me watching was to see if Max and Logan would ever get rid of the nasty virus infecting Max Very good drama in season two But of course like all TV shows if theres something a little wrong with it the broadcasting company takes it off the air I was seriously hoping for a third and final season Season 2 leaves you hanging unless you read the books by Max Allan Collins then you will know what happensbr br Dark Angel should be put back on the air for one more season even though it might cost a lot just to get all the original actors again since Jessica Albas carrier sky rocketed after the show If that would be the case then there should be a movie to complete it just like the show Firefly which of course FOX canceled as well
1	Lars Von Triers Europa is an extremely good film Hows that Von Trier has a very stylized way to tell a story at least he did have with Europa To me the whole film was like an experience even if I did see it on a small television screen Even with all the tricks in my opinion this film is the most complete REAL and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top 250 list I also think it is perhaps the scariest the most gothic and complete film around All right there are other good ones too but this one is my favorite The final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever
1	This is probably my favorite movie of all time It is perfection in its storytelling It will break your heart not because its over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through You feel for Doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in China at that time
0	First of all I thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by Preston Sturges Sturges was one of the better Hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired However it wasnt the Preston Sturges it was Preston Sturges Jr The story was essentially based on Robert Louis Stevensons short story The Bottle Imp A good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell Thats fine Nobody said screenwriters had to be original The actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen My biggest complaint comes with the ending The hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person At first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very end of the film This is a stupid convention The older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the end There is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think You can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end In fact I think its preferable

1	This film was the first British teen movie to actually address the reality of the violent rock and roll society rather than being a lucid parody of 1950s teenage life In an attempt to celebrate the work of Liverpools Junior Liaison Officers the opening title points out that 92 of potential delinquents who have been dealt with under this scheme have not committed a second crime However this becomes merely a pretext to the following teendrama until the films epilogue where we are instructed that we shouldnt feel responsible or sorry for such delinquents however mixedup they might seembr br Stanley Baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of Juvenile Liaison Officer This hardboiled character is a role typical of Baker Having been currently on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as the firefly and does not relish the distraction of the transfer However as in all good police dramas he is led back full circle by a remarkable turn of events back to his original investigationbr br His first case leads him to the home of two young children Mary and Patrick Murphy played by reallife brother and sister duo who have committed a petty theft Here he meets Cathie satisfyingly portrayed by Anne Heywood their older sister whom he eventually becomes romantically involved with It quickly becomes obvious that the squalid environment of such innercity estates is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquencybr br The elder brother of the Murphy family Johnny is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums McCallum does an eyecatching turn as the Americanized mixedup kid who owes more to the likes of Marlon Brando than any previous British star One is reminded of Brandos character Johnny from The Wild One who led a leatherclad gang of rebellious bikers in much the same way as this films Johnny leads his gangbr br Thankfully the preachiness of earlier Dearden crime dramas such as The Blue Lamp is not so apparent Instead we are presented with several well drawnout characters on both sides of the law as the drama of the delinquents and the romantic interest between Heywood and Baker takes the forefrontbr br The plot whilst at times predictable does deliver some memorable scenes The disruptive influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had is played out in a scene where Johnny abandons himself to the music leading a menacing advance on the police sergeant The most grippingly memorable piece of film however is the climatic classroom scene where a bunch of terrified school children including Mary and Patrick are held hostage at gunpoint by Johnny Obviously in the light of the reallife Dumblaine Massacre this scene seems all the horrifying Understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences
0	Dont bother to watch this film would be better advice if you like Marilyn Monroe in her other roles This was a huge disappointment considering the great cast not just Marilynbr br The story was just nothing certainly nothing like described on the VHS box of course There simply was no suspense precious little excitement and too many dull spots most of them trying to show why Nellie Monroe was so messed up This was not a good role for Monroe even though I didnt need to see this character to know she could act Some Like It Hot alone was good enough evidence for me But this role just didnt fit her and its no surprise it wasnt one of her more popular filmsbr br Its also too bad a film had the waste of the talents of actors like Richard Widmark Anne Bancroft Elisha Cook Jr Jeanne Cagney Donna Cocoran and others br br Summary its not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game
1	This spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen It shows a China I had never seen or imagined and I believe it shows 1930s China in the most REAL light ever seen in a movie It is absolutely heartbreaking in so many situations seeing how hard life was for the characters and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful You truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film The actors are all perfect such that you feel like you have really entered a different world br br I simply can not recommend this movie highly enough It may just change you forever once you have seen it
1	My rating refers to the first 4 Seasons of Stargate SG1 which are wonderfully fresh creative and addicting When the cast stepped through the gate you never knew what lay on the other side Starting around Season 5 the show took a different focus still good but differentbr br The series follows the adventures of a team of humans and one alien who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the Stargate The backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie Stargate in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in Egyptbr br The episodes are light innocent and easy to watch and very creative Many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great scifi movies of their own What happens next was always unpredictablebr br The characters on which the show rests are also welldefined and brilliantly performed Their tone is serious but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor They are simply fun to watchbr br Starting somewhere around Season 5 the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe the Goauld then the Ori The plots become more complex a lot more politicalstrategic oriented and interdependent The characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in naturebr br One thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes They are simply cantmiss shows They exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasonsbr br If you are a scifi fan watch a few episodes of the first 4 Seasons and youll likely be hooked If you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to
0	This movie is such a bad work Nothing seems to even try and be realistic Plot is weak acting miserable actors wondering around like in a 1st year production trying very hard to act with no chance at all from the beginning What a flop What a waste of time money and effort to all concerned including the audience Well as in any thriller here too are murders corpses and blood Just imagine someone who 5 minutes ago committed a murder with a knife and came out calm and smiling not to mention clean as a whistle as if slashing ones throat is done by a virtual agent Also this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male and she cut his throat Did she ask him politely to bend down for her Much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering if this meant to be a joke which just turned out to be a bad one Continuity is another huge problem as for instance The eagerhungry groom is lying in bed waiting for his virginbride to get out of the bathroom and after a long while falls asleep Next scene opens with the young couple entering the receptionarea asking for guidance to scenery spots NOT A WORD ABOUT LAST NIGHT Such a waste of time even to try and write about this lowlow supposedtobe movie

1	Twelve years ago production stopped on the slasher flick Hot Blooded since almost everyone on the set started dying Now a couple of film students have decided to finish the film despite the fact that theres a rumor that the film is cursed Well theyre about to find out that some curses are realbr br When Scream was released every country seemed to want to cash in on its success even Australia The concept which today has been done to death a slasher film within a slasher film was at the time relatively cool and original This movie was released right before Urban Legends Final Cut and Scream 3 well not in the US but in Australia so it felt like the first movie with this concept When Urban Legends 2 was released most of us had all ready grown sick of the concept and since the movie wasnt even good the movie flopped disastrously Now Cut is not the best slasher flick ever and nor does it try to be It knows that its a ripoff and they even cast a girl who looks like a blonde version of Neve Campbell in the starring role But instead of trying to add some new and original twists to the story theyve decided to ripoff some 80s slasher flicks like Nightmare on Elm Street as well and surprisingly enough this actually works The killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer And instead of trying to scare the audience to death theyve created a very good and creepy atmosphere which keeps us in suspense through most of the movie There are a couple of plot holes in the movie though that I wasnt able to fully ignore the ending being the biggest plot hole in the movie Spoiler ahead I mean they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene It makes no sense I tell you End of spoilers All in all Cut is a pretty creepy slasher flick with a silly story but I consider this to be one of the better Scream ripoffs that never made it big Im surprised that this one never got a sequel but I guess it simply came out too late br br Suspenseful Australian slasher flick with very few scares Cut is still a pretty neat slasher movie and I will have to recommend this one even though I consider the story to be quite silly since its completely ludicrous
0	I love all types of films especially horror That being said Survival does not live up to ANY of the hype surrounding itbr br I cant give it any points on originality There is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes or remaking what others have done It has just become a cop out for indie films to take us on a slasher journey through the woods a crazed killer and as of lately throw in some crazy family On those lines I have to compare it with the likes of Texas Chainsaw Wrong Turn though the twist in that one is obvious and others Survival falls up way short against comparable films The plot was just not original in ANY way Some films can get by with a weak and way overdone plot with superb acting special fx or a slew of other factors Survivial doesnt have any of that to bank on If you will note the following The acting in the movie never took off I dont knock or blame the actors for that nor the director The dialogue was at best mediocre and the actors involved never showed not saying didnt HAVE the talent to pull it off I mention 2 standouts The leading man in this film certainly has the look but I seriously thinks he needs to consider more training before he is ready to carry a film The actor who portrayed Greg also had potential but we never got to see any of it watch the movie to see why you wont believe itbr br The grainy film look Ah yes that little tidbit of film making magic designed to take us to the glory days of Grindhouse films In todays film making that has become a gimmick It either works or it doesnt In this case it just does not work There are too many other flaws going on so it winds up distracting from the film not adding to it That being said I think they did a good job of adding that grain That is some good quality grain I think with a different script better direction and possibly actors they should try another Grindhouse attempt They will probably pull it offbr br As far as the tech aspects in my opinion they never quite gelled for me either Better care could have been taken with audio sounds like it was fed directly into the camera but there is nothing wrong with that and for being shot on DV it was too soft for my tastebr br That is all I have to say about that
1	Elephant Walk 1954 Starring an early Peter Finch as lord of the manor in some Godforsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad Englishmen staying out in the midday sun and going berserk Well eventually they do after the typhoid or cholera outbreak of course and much mayhem ensues Taylor replaced an ailing Vivien Leigh in this pot boileradventure flick When the elephants storm the house and trap Liz on the grand staircase I still get goose bumps Thank goodness Dana Andrews is around to save the day One of my favorite guilty pleasures In color too
1	Yes its an art to successfully make a slow paced thrillerbr br The story unfolds in nice volumes while you dont even notice it happeningbr br Fine performance by Robin Williams The sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film However the core plot is very engaging The movie doesnt rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering The direction is good Use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is goodbr br Very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story
0	When I spotted that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie I was like score I admit I was eager to see the movie And I have to say the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgic in a way Then it went all down hill I didnt expect it to be a dump of politically correct civil rights mumbo jumbo They took every possible controversial topic and threw it into one stupid story I was appalled that Noah was involved in anything of the sort especially his role Nobody with a fully functional brain would actually accept all that crap about the Vietnam War If anyone really wants to know how Communism was like sit down and read a book on it And not one that praises it or is against it just the cold hard factsbr br I only watched a few scenes here and there only because I wanted to see Rickys body but that was all that interested me Everything else about this movie irritated me
0	I just saw the movie in theater The movie has very few good points to talk about Kareenas beauty and a couple of songs may be Thats it The movie is a complete disappointment in all areas Anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed even Mumbai Indians too just now Chennai has made it to semifinal br br But the worst I feel about the movie is the action scenes Now days Bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from Hollywood But they forget that Hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real But unfortunately Bollywood directors do not have that much of time They spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie Now such too stupid action scenes may work in South as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people But in Bollywood this is certainly not going to work All the action scenes I wish I could have forwarded At the end even some Chinese people appear from nowhere to beat Akshay Kumar This is height of stupidity Audience is not paying to watch such stupidity I think Bollywood now should forget about the action movies They cant make it The last good action I have seen was from Ghatak and Khiladiyon ka Khialdi The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me Does these people see their movie after completion Cant they figure out that the slow motion action which is done using ropes is too unrealistic and childish Better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it I just want to go back to Amitabhs era where movie like Zanjeer and Deewar were having thrilling action scenes The sound effect was not very effective in those days but visually it is much better than current era scenes br br This movie now should open the eyes of the Bollywood movie directors Please dont make any more action movies until you acquire the art of making it realistic
0	I have seen some bad movies Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me Batman Forever but this film is so awful so BORING that I got about half way through and could not bear watching the rest A pity Boasting talent such as Kenneth Branagh Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and a story by John Grisham what went wrong Branagh is a bigtime lawyer who has a onenight fling with Davitz Her father Duvall is a psychopath who hanged her cat etc etc so Branagh has him sent to a nuthouse and he promptly escapes Somehow I couldnt figure out how Robert Downey jr Daryl Hannah Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are all mixed into the story which moves slower than stationary I wanted to like this and being a huge Grisham fan have read all about this movie and I foolishly expected something interesting This is honestly the WORST film Ive seen to date and I wish I could have my money refunded out of
0	A friend of mine lent this video to me and I was fairly excited to watch it but after ten minutes of James Hetfields slow pitched vocals and Lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion I began to think Why am I watching this That question will be coursing through your minds in 5  10 minutes after you hit Play I gave the tape back the same day as you would suspect not worth buying or watchingbr br Just my opinionbr br
0	This is quite possibly the most retarded 80s slasher ever realized but how can you be harsh on a film that features nonstop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits Prior to being a horror film Aerobicide is a 90 minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids silicons and other bodystimulating fitness products If youd leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable 80s tunes there probably only have about 15 minutes of story left Plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young healthfreaks with a big safety pin yeah The film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sunbathing device Several years later people turn up dead in the same spa You dont really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out theres a link between the murders and the burning incident now do you Investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer and Charles Napier lookalike and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest 80s beauty Ive ever seen Looking through the credits her names Dianne Copeland apparently and she didnt do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile Tromamovie called Surf Nazis Must Die What a wasted opportunity She may not have been a great actress but she sure had two other BIG advantages that would help her move upwards in show business The amount of gore and the quality of the makeup effects are nothing special neither Were treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh The plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore anyway Aerobicide aka Killer Workout is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night but nevertheless feel like watching a film It actually would make a terrific doublefeature with Death Spa Both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes and both films are pretty dumb
1	When it came out this was pretty much state of the art musical film entertainment To this day its more entertaining than most in great part because it has James Cagney in the lead role as a musical prologue producer under a succession of deadlines and sheltered from all storms by his trusty girl Friday played by Joan Blondell Also the musical numbers towards the end which were put together by Busby Berkeley are pretty much a knockout as far as that type of thing goesbr br But this is a pretty strange movie I mean in one of those numbers youve got Billy Barty running around pretending to be a lovable toddler doing all kinds of weird stuff Ruby Keeler seems to have a sickening smile plastered on her face at all times but at least shes not required to act like in some of her later unfortunate films Youd never guess that Dick Powell was any kind of tough guy from seeing him in this movie apparently all the tough guy energy was allocated to the star Cagney As for Cagney his high speed rants about musical shows and so forth are endearing and annoying at the same time After a while it gets a bit too much You expect him to walk out and say Hey Ive got a great idea for a prologue The women are cigarettes and they come out of a pack of smokes Oh no we did that one last month Its funny but it gets a bit repetitive In the moments where he has to get tough with the bad girl Ruth Donnelly some of the established Cagney gangster character comes out In fact frequent B gangster director William Keighley is credited here with dialogue coaching and it seems at times that Cagney and Blondell are invoking something very street even though the characters arent criminalbr br The musical numbers what can you say They stand alone as entertainment the way that Berkeley uses the human body and geometry is really startling But none of them really mean anything It means Honeymoon Hotel nothing really more or less And the whole pretense of the integration falls apart immediately since the characters in the show are doing things that couldnt possibly be appreciated by a theater audience like the movie portrays For example at one point they show the fine print on a newspaper things like that The whole thing could only exist on film so the idea that the prologues are actually live shows is ridiculous I can only suppose that audiences of the time were somewhat less critical about things like this than they would be ten years later or so because this is a very polished productionbr br Its great to see Cagney himself show off his superb dancing skills and he can actually share the stage with a dancer like Keeler Cagney and Blondell have excellent chemistry and their scenes go off really well The music I would say is only mediocre but mostly pleasing if repetitive Bacons direction in general is very suitable but never interesting The films entertainment value is unquestionable and it has also picked up some nostalgic value along the way Its a cut above most lets put on a show films of the 30s
0	Disney What happened I really wish the movie had been set in the 60s like the book was And I really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption Im glad that maybe someone might be influenced to read the books but The Man With Red Eyes interchangeable as IT And whats up with the volcanic upheaval Where was THAT in the book Peter Jackson Save us A long time ago 1978 I heard that there was European version of this film I sure wish I could id it I can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption This movie needs to be Xd
0	Ive read some of the comments about this film and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained This movie is nothing Its so badly written directed and acted that it barely makes an impression The characters speak in clicheridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible While that might make this campy and fun it doesnt because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull Its as if Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either wasnt allowed by studio execs to give the story some truetolife gusto or didnt have the cojones This movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standardissue bad Lifetime TV movie
1	All i hear about is how poorly the animation is done It may not be up to par with what everyone expects but look at it this way Would you expect perfection in hell It is my belief that the animation was made dry and gritty on purpose It was great to see her character transformation in this movie considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get I hope for a sequel very soon If we want live action i think we may be better off with Chastity or Purgatori I dont think Lady Death would transfer well to film But be that as it may It is my own personal belief that all the naysayers about this movie are DEAD wrong No pun intended
1	Ever since I can remember and Im only 18 my mother and I have been and continue to watch older movies because well I find them much more rewarding in the long run but hey dont get me wrong I do love the movies we have today just not as much as I love movies of the 40s and 50s Anyways now I have to say the moment I started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the TV Of course my favorite character was the Grandmother played by Lucile Watson But I loved the way Betty Davis and her family was portrayed The childrendid not act like children in the slightest But there is good reason for that having had to hid and run most of your life seeing the awful things children saw those days destroyed their innocence So people saying oooo i hated how the kids actedblah blah blah read between the lines and know they saw things children should not seebr br Paul Lukasdear Paul did an amazing job Now I know many people are mad that he go the Oscar and Bogie didnt but hey they both did amazing jobs so I think it could have gone either way But Lukas performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie I was reduced to tears I loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone D
1	Well its been a long year and Im down to reviewing the final film for 2004 Panaghoy Sa Suba Call of The River placed second in the recent Metro Manila Film Festival As expected it didnt do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since MMFF is the season where a lot of families go out to see moviesbr br It was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in Filipino or English play out in the screen I thought Cesar Montano did a good job both as a star and director His great vision and creativity really helped this film He was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film Also performing well was young actress Rebecca Lusterio She did a great job portraying Bikay the younger sister of Duroy I hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres I think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped herbr br Some of the camera shots in the film were done very well The scenery was made breathtaking even though I feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely differentbr br In terms of the story I feel that the writers could have delved further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film I certainly wont be raving about the story of this film
1	The story of a drifter his sheep ranch boss and the bosss daughter is not for all tastes but its still very intriguing It takes place in the beautiful country of New Zealand amongst the scenery weve come to know so well through other films from this regionbr br This movie was the first time I had ever seen the excellent Mary Regan and Ive been a fan of hers ever since The cast also contains Bruno Lawrence who is probably best remembered by American audiences from the film Smash Palace Terence Cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter Regan br br Sharply acted with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads I first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in America but believe you me the unexpurgated version is not to be missed
1	This is a good movie but it is not recommended if you dont like intelligent movies Its about two guys that wish that the world would go awayand thats exactly what they get The acting is great the ending was not predictableand it actually had a good story unlike most movies these days People complain about the movie being too simple or too boring I think they should just stick to movies like The Toxic Avenger I actually like B movies or The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy One note If you notice this this has exactly the same actors from Cube except four actors Make it two notes Wait after the credits Trust me on this one Enjoy the movie
0	One two three four five six seven eight and back haha This is a must see first of all to see the work out There are a lot of work out shown see those close ups man you will enjoy it A few years ago a video clip was surely based on this movie Its a slasher but without suspense The ending is funny too and the clothes shes wearing in the wood confronting the copper Jesus looks like a clown The killings are mostly done off screen the blood flows but never too gory There are a lot of fight scenes too and hey no one got hurt And what about the weapon to kill never seen a big one like that wont spoil it you must see it And being a slasher theres a lot of TA too To guess whos the killer you will be trapped a few times and thats the best part but what about the story of the copper in the woods huh But still due his cheesiness this one is still one that many would like to have Im glad that I have my copy one of those slasher failures But man those clothes and not to mention the hairstyles If you are in your 40s then this is one is back to memory lane
0	I just watched this horrid thing on TV Needless to say it is one of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse it can get Frankly I dont know how much lower the bar can go br br The characters are composed of one lame stereotype after another and the obvious attempt at creating another Bad News Bears is embarrassing to say the VERY leastbr br I have seen some prized turkeys in my time but there is no reason to list any of them since this is Numero Unobr br Let me put it to you this way I watched the Vanilla Ice movie because it was so bad it was funny Thisthisis NOT even that good
0	Im starting to think that theres a conspiracy all right one that involves a wallop of money paid to those who have access to published columns in newspapers and film and art magazines to ensure that this or that film despite its obscurity will reach a higher status via a ratings point which will tag it with a universal acclaim or something within that range thus ensuring unsuspecting folk like me will wander into theatres or rent the bloody thing expecting a surprise only to find myself racing to the bathroom to upchuckbr br This movie is one of them It has definitely make me bypass any and every posted article I come across because its rather clear that two things might have happened either I didnt get the message that is so hidden beneath this films inner realms as to be impossible to access or they and I watched two entirely different movies that happen to share the same name 4 is a dirty trick on the audience Its no wonder that it appeared and disappeared faster than you can say smorsgabord and that despite the rating it got on Metacritic no one had heard of it Its terrible with sugar on topbr br Firstly there is the everpresent number four from start to finish While having a little symbolism here and there is okay and its been done with various degrees of success in many wellknown movies this movie is panting with it Four dogs at the start of the movie looking at the camera in a heretofore empty street when suddenly machinery drops onto the foreground and proceeds to rip open the asphalt Four people in a bar although one of them is a nonentity Three of them go their separate ways but are linked nevertheless not only to each other but to what their lives are not While this concept may work the movie meanders so much particularly with the story of the wouldbe model played by Marina Vovchenko which goes into the territory of the extremely bizarre and not in a good way that the initial theme gets lost in translation Or maybe like I said before I just didnt get it The problem also lies in that so much time is spent on Marinas story which revolves on the death of her sister from breadchewing no less and the subsequent shrill mourning which follows that any interest in the inherent Surrealism dissipates without a trace So what if the same horrifying tales that the three strangers interchanged in a bar seem to have a truth of their own The director doesnt invest much time in truly tying them together or weaving a tighter story that could in a David Lynchian way intersect either with the pastpresent or within alternate dimensions or even as a straightforward mundane sciencefiction story This is an uphill battle against an insurmountable wall that only a saint or someone into the weird for weirds sake could endure
1	From what critics and audiences indicated BIRTHDAY GIRL had to be a big fat clinker Still because I love Nicole Kidman I decided to rent it last night It proved to be quite worthy of watching Sure it isnt your basic American comedy and it doesnt take a genius to realize that it is a very British movie but thats why I liked it It was a change from all the other movies around a breath of fresh air Sure there were some plot holes but overall it worked First off Kidman was fabulous again in a very different not very glamorous but still quite sexy role She just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in Hollywood Not only is her Russian accent when she speaks English effective but there are times when she carries on long conversations in Russian and if you didnt know it was Nicole Kidman you would never question her authenticity Harrison Ford should have taken note in K19 Overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz
1	Dark Angel is a cross between Huxleys Brave New World and Percys Love in the Ruinsportraying the not too distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order both in the worst sense of the word Once one swallows the premise that all modern technology can be brought to a standstill by the Pulse it provides an entertaining landscape for exploring the personalities of and relationships between the two primary charactersMax the Dark Angelbike messenger and Logan the rich rebel It seems uneven perhaps a result of a variety of authors but is held together by the energetic beautiful and charming Jessica Alba who seems both strong and calloused yet vulnerable and sensitive I think that Fox has done it again
0	This is an awful film Yea the girls are pretty but its not very good The plot having a cowboy get involved with an Indian maiden would be interesting if the sex didnt get in the way Well okay it might be interesting but its not because its so badly paced and and only partly acted I can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen probably more laughable then they do on TV I wont even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest Never read about that in the old west This is a film that requires liberal use of fast forwardbr br I like schlock films but this is ridiculous There is a reason that I dont go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good the plot taking a back seat to breasts The original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats The clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent The comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level infantile but harmlessly fun Something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudiebr br The Ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex filmbr br I need not watch this againbr br Of interest to probably no one the rapist and killer in the film was played by Bobby Beausoleil a member of the Manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrappedbr br Obviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives
0	The finale of the Weissmuller Tarzan movies is a rather weak one There are a few things that derail this filmbr br First Tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals In my opinion any footwear on Tarzan whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed takes away from the character which is supposed to be anticivilization and projunglebr br Second the character of Benji as mentioned in a previous post totally derails the movie as the comic foil To me his character is unnecessary to the films plotbr br Also while Weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as Tarzan its apparent that he was not in his best shape Although in his later Jungle Jim movies his physique had improved somewhat from this filmbr br The octopus battle is a terrific idea but I think it should have been done in an earlier Weissmuller film when he was at his physical peak Likewise the battle which takes only 30 seconds tops would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in Tarzan and His Matebr br And while Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye it doesnt manage to salvage this last Weissmuller film a disappointing ending to a great character run
1	It isnt the worst film ever made the actors arent apalling and the script and director are not completely inept br br It isnt the best film ever made the actors arent excellent and the script and director are not completely brilliantbr br It falls somewhere in the middle A fun somewhere An enjoyable well constructed somewherebr br No need to say dont take it seriously or so bad its good or it wasnt scary None of these comments are relevant br br Cut has atmosphere Its that atmosphere which is actually very unique and the one really original aspect of the movie which personally is what makes the film for me

0	I saw this movie on a westbound American Airlines flight It was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer The plot had potential who wouldnt love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every Elvis impersonator she meets but it got screwed up a million different times by really poor writing Towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of Elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino reshipping the sky thinking hes going to return then a group of stars moves together to form an Elvis constellation which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning at the impersonators sending them crashing through the roof BadREALLY bad Which is the theme for the whole movie Id avoid this one at all costs
1	Well its about time I had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this seasons entries While there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries at least this episode turned out well Its rather funny that director Rob Schmidt who only has the not bad Wrong Turn to his credit and writer John Esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season In Right To Die we are treated to the story of Cliff and Abbey At the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation Abbey has caught Cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back While they speak they find themselves in a car accident where Cliff is left with only scratches and bruises but Abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire And this is just the setup people Once in the hospital Cliff must decide whether or not Abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes Theres also a side effect too Every time she flatlines Abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people Hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever From the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists I never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it Right To Die should have the right to go on living forever

1	This movie deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases among the aging today As one who has encountered a number of families who are facing the potential of Alzheimers or who are in the formative stages I would suggest that every health care giver recommend this movie to any family facing the trauma of this disease The movie is designed primarily to speak to the family of the patient and reaches into the very heart of the struggle Casting is excellent and the dramatic portrayal is outstanding with a very commanding plot line

0	Did HeidiJean really see this movie A great Christmas movie Not even close Dull bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart I kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that Carly Pope could play the lead in this movie The woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance Baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing Probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with Maybe Im expecting too much for a Lifetime movie played 15 days from Christmas but I sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting JJ with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie
1	Though structured totally different from the book by Tim Krabbé who wrote the original The Vanishing Spoorloos it does have the same overall feel except for that Koolhovens style is less businesslike and more lyric The beginning is great the middle is fine but the sting is in the end A surprise emotional ending As you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film but it is done all very beautifully Never explicit but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour It is a shame American films cant be as open an honoust as this one Where Dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject De Grot stays always within the boundaries of good taste De Grot tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years When youll leave the cinema youll be moved What can we ask more of a film Anyway this film even gives more

1	I first discovered Alexander Kordas 1940 Fantasy THE THIEF OF BAGDAD in the early 1950s on a reissue billed as The Wonder Show of the Century Both Korda Technicolor films THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown on one never to be forgotten program The music of Miklos Rozsa enhanced both films The Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made As the years passed it became more difficult to enjoy the films color in the way it had originally been presented in True Technicolor gave way to a Eastman Color process in the middle 1950s Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video But the Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original Technicolor The Laser Disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it nice but not as it should be NOW comes the MGM DVD 3 Dec 2002 issue THE THIEF OF BAGDAD again has the wonderful Technicolor look to it on a DVD that is nothing short of STUNNING It was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the DVD once I watched it a second time The only Extras are a Spanish Dubbed version SubTitles in both English Spanish and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer Thank you MGM for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD release Now one can only hope that Kordas FOUR FEATHERS and a restored version of Kordas JUNGLE BOOK to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation will soon follow on DVD
0	I only recently found out that Madeleine LEngles novel had been turned into a TV movie by Disney and ordered the DVD The book was a favorite of mine when I was a child and I read it several timesbr br Despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel the Murry family is well cast with a likable if too pretty Meg at the center and a Charles Wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating br br The first half hour is promising enough doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene Unfortunately as soon as the nonhuman characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart Alfre Woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric Mrs Whatsit think Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright instead and Kate Nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive she must have visited Faye Dunaways plastic surgeon in recent years For some reason they make her Mrs Which look like Glinda from The Wizard of Oz when she should have resembled a benign Wicked Witch of the Westbr br In the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction I understand that this is a TV movie but the CGI looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier Mrs Whatsits centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the Chewbacca like suit for Aunt Beast who in the novel is a velvety elegant creature instead of the ungainly Big Foot like thing shown here I could go on and on nearly every artistic choice is a disaster presumably because there wasnt a large enough budget to do this justice but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgementbr br This really would have needed the sense of wonder Spielberg brought to his early films What a shame that with the current popularity of adapting childrens literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting A Wrinkle in Time and its sequels for the big screen giving it the scope it deserves
