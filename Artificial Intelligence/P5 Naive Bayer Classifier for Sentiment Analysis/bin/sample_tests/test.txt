0	This movie is just plain dumbbr br From the casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the fatuous climax the film is an exercise in wooden predictabilitybr br Mike Hammer is one of detective fictions true sociopaths Unlike Marlow and Spade who put pieces together to solve the mystery Hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth This film turns Hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are well too dumb to get away with anything One is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attackbr br Other parts of the movie are right out of the Three Stooges play book Veldas dance at the barre for instance or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back And the continuity breaks are shameful Frau Blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but shes way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot The worst break however precedes the popcorn attack The bad guy stalking Hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guybr br To be fair there were some interesting camera angles and lighting and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10
1	I didnt approach Still Crazy with any real anticipation Just another rocknroll picture I figured good nostalgia for the baby boomers This film is partially that but so much more Brian Gibson the director previously helmed a biography of Tina Turner and is quite successful in his style I suppose it is fitting that this was his last filmbr br The cast is wellchosen Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as the bands frontman Actorturneddirector Bruce Robinson appears as the bands washedup guitarist He does a superb job even though he hasnt appeared on film since the late 70s If youre looking for an touching and funny film with some great songs youve found itbr br 74 out of 10
1	Forget the campy religious movies that have monopolized the televisionfilm market this movie has a real feel to it While it may be deemed as a movie that has cheap emotional draws it also has that message of forgiveness and overall good morals However I did not like the lighting in this movie for a movie dealing with such subject matter it was too bright I felt it took away from the overall appeal of the movie which is almost an unforgivable sin but the recognizable cast and their performances counteract this oversightbr br Definitely worth seeing buy the DVD
1	Leonard Maltin mustve been watching some other movie Though I find his Guide to be quite a valuable resource please disregard his comments on this one He states starts off well then fizzles when its really the reverse starts off tepid then catches fire The plot is about as simple as it gets Happy Mom Happy Dad and Happy Son take a vacation at an isolated beach Dad incapacitated in accident Mom runs off to get help meets up with dangerous escaped convict Mom tries to trick convict into helping while Dad waits and hangs on for dear lifebr br Good whiteknuckler given an electric jolt by Ralph Meeker appearing suddenly the director John Sturges films it in a clever way that will make you gasp around halfway through as the cunning desperate criminal Meeker is an unusually flippant reckless actor at least here and in the classic Kiss Me Deadly and he happily snatches the keys to the films narrative and speeds off with the top down His character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying Pretty neat huh when hes especially pleased with his misdeeds There is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he tersely instructs his hostage Barbara Stanwyck Dont go away She fires back Where would I go theyre in the middle of nowhere and he realizes sitcomishly Yeah thats right The friction between them is a hootbr br There are flaws somewhat ridiculous ones Theres one scene where the police who have been chasing after Meeker for some time stop Stanwycks car and to evade detection Meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would and pretends to be asleep as shes being questioned A He looks conspicuously unmasculine in this pose and B I think its safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement would certainly arouse suspicionbr br Still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusionbr br
1	Coinciding with the start of the baby boom the years after World War II saw an unprecedented exodus of Americans moving out of their city apartments into the suburbs where they can fulfill their dreams of owning their own homes Directed by HC Potter and cowritten by Norman Panama and Melvin Frank White Christmas this lightweight but surprisingly observant 1948 screwball comedy captures the feeling of that period very well Of course it helps to have a trio of expert farceurs  Cary Grant Myrna Loy and an especially acerbic Melvyn Douglas  head the proceedings with their natural likability at odds with the escalating frustrations of home ownership Even though the film is sixty years old now there is a timeless quality to the Blandings dream and the barriers they face in achieving it Obviously Hollywood thinks so since its been remade at least twice first as a very physical Tom Hanks comedy 1986s The Money Pit and again last year with Ice Cubes Are We Done Yet One look at HGTVs programming schedule will show you how the situations explored here still resonate todaybr br The plot begins with ad man Jim Blandings his wife Muriel and their two daughters cramped into a two bedroomone bath Manhattan apartment Rather than pursue Muriels idea to renovate the apartment for 7000 Jim sees a photo of a Connecticut house in a magazine and realizes this is where they need to move With the help of an opportunistic real estate agent and against the advice of their attorney and family friend Bill Cole the Blandings decide to buy a ramshackle house badly in need of repair However the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one This sparks the Blandings to push the architect to design a house so excessive that the second floor is twice as big as the first Costs rise with each new complication tempers flare and even a romantic triangle is imagined among Jim Muriel and Bill Priorities finally sort themselves out but not before some funny slapstick scenes and clever dialogue that tweaks the notsoblissful ignorance of the new homeownersbr br With his double takes and flawless line delivery Grant is infallible in this type of farce and Jim Blandings epitomizes his more domesticated midcareer characters In a role originally meant for Irene Dunne Myrna Loy shows why she was Hollywoods perfect wife She doesnt get many of the funnier lines but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make Muriel an appealing character on her own Watch her deftly maneuver the overly agreeable house painter with her absurdly idiosyncratic color palette As avuncular pipesmoking Bill Cole Bill Cole Melvyn Douglas shows his natural easygoing élan as Grants foil Smaller roles are filled expertly with particularly memorable turns by Harry Shannon as the laconic welldigger Mr Tesander Lurene Tuttle as Jims officious assistant Mary and Louise Beavers as the Blandings lovable maid Gussie The 2004 DVD provides some intriguing vintage material including two radio versions of the movie the first a 1949 version that did end up pairing Grant and Dunne and then a second 1950 version coupling Grant with his thenwife actress Betsy Drake A most appropriate 1949 cartoon The House of Tomorrow is also included giving us a comical tour of a futuristic dream house The original theatrical trailers for ten of Grants film classics complete the extras

0	This is arguably the worst film I have ever seen and I have quite an appetite for awful and good movies It could just have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongueincheek à la ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW which was really very funny Other movies like PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious As to the acting it looks like they rounded up braindead teenagers and asked them to adlib the whole production Compared to them Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness There was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoulbusting broad on the motorcycle
0	I rented this movie last week I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it so it seemed promising And it was until Justin Timberlake came on scene He is a really bad actor and shouldnt be allowed to make a movie ever again I mean he is one of the most boring uninspired actors Ive ever seen He puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever Why the hell was he cast for the role of Josh Pollack I think Matt Damon would have been a better choicebr br Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment His character is so dull it seems like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en It might sound cool but believe me its notbr br Now Dylan McDermotts acting is very good Its about one of the very few good things about this movie He is just inspiredbr br Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special He has some really cool lines thoughbr br About the story although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good I was expecting a big twist when Lazerov Dylan McDermott was killed but nothing really happened
0	Tashan the title itself explains the nature of the moviebr br This type of movies are actually made for flop What a shame that Yash Raj Films produces such movies those are worthless than Cgrade movies Or even some Cgrade movies have better and pleasing story than Tashan The much hyped and overconfidently promoted Tashan poorly bombed at the boxoffice which it certainly deservedbr br In my view this is the worst movie ever made from honourable Yash Raj Films banner How come they handled such a heavy project to new Vijay Krishna Acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick He tried to imitate Sanjay Gadhvis ways of making like Dhoom but he suffered at last The action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiencesbr br The story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences hearts In most scenes Anil Kapoor reminds me of southern Tamil star Rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions I am not a fan of neither Saif nor Akshay but the award of Kareena should have finally gone to Saifs hand instead of Akshay Just from the starting point I expected of it but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth Saif is the main behind the whole adventure while Akshay joins in the midst In any movie the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit And Tashan loses in this way and unexpectedly failed to become a hitbr br Akshays has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies He seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again In between Saif did a great job in Race and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie But he has fully developed himself in the acting field And last but not the least about Kareena She looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean But I myself dont think so instead she became slim Yes slim it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people or say male Beside them it is nice that Saifs son Ibrahim appears in the beginning last as young Saif I hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his careerbr br Those who like this Tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood or say want to be admitted in an asylum Thumbs down to debutante director Vijay Krishna Acharya who mishandled the project offered by Yash Raj Films In future he should experiment and study the script minimum of 5 years before going into practical directionsbr br Sorry I dont like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies
0	I saw this film at a prerelease screening at the Writers Guild theater in Beverly Hills As I recall the films producers and director were in attendance presumably to gage our reactionbr br Many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience which would have been fine if it had been a comedy but it was supposed to be a horror filmbr br If the audience wasnt scared it seems the filmmakers were They delayed release for over a year Out of curiosity I saw it again to see if theyd recut it as far as I can tell they hadnt It was the same lousy movie just a year olderbr br It almost qualifies as so bad its good but its slowpaced and boring
1	This is a great film The first time I saw it I thought it was absorbing from start to finish and I still do now I may not have seen the play but even if I had it wouldnt stop me thinking that the film is just as good
1	It may or may not be considered interesting that the only reason I really checked out this movie in the first place was because I wanted to see the performance of the man who beat out Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA 1010 role for the Best Actor Oscar I still would have given the Oscar to Bogie but Paul Lukas did do a great job and deserved the nomination at least Well Im glad I did check this movie out because I enjoyed it immensely I think the movie did preach a little but not only did I not mind I enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with thembr br The acting was outstanding in this movie I especially enjoyed Paul Lukas Lucile Watson rightfully nominated for an Oscar Bette Davis wrongfully not nominated George Coulouris and oddly Eric Roberts who plays the middle child I really enjoyed his character an oddlooking boy who talks like some sort of philosopher He just cracks me up Even the characters name Bodo is funny br br The ending in which Lukass character was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons worked for me as well I agreed with why he felt he had to what he did and I understood why he couldnt quite explain it The message this movie makes is a good and noble one the scenery meaning the house is beautiful and the acting is the excellent Watch this movie if you ever get a chancebr br 910
1	Great actors an oscar nominee actress stunning scenery good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag and thats quite big This film was brilliant It was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were well side splitting I have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the stoned ladies in the tea shop scene Well done to the British film industry and to Craig Ferguson whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favourite films of the year if not of all time
1	I really do not know what people have against this film but its definitely one of my favourites Its not preachy its not anchored by its moral it shouldnt be controversial Its just God Any possible God no matter the religion And its really funnybr br Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan a TV reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news desperate to prove himself more or less TO himself that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job This drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend Grace Jennifer Aniston away When the final straws are executed hes quick to not laugh but yell in the face of God who in turn gives Bruce his powers Bruce then makes his life better for himself until hes guilted into helping others where he then continues to miss the point of his powers Meanwhile his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish leaving his relationship on dangerous groundbr br OK that was kinda long But as a plot it works well The stepbystep fashion in which we meet the challenges of being God is much better than clustering his problems together and is able to hide itself fairly wellbr br As you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place Carreys pitchperfect acting stays in character which luckily enough is him and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene Whether they would admit it or not the role was written or rewritten exclusively for Carrey Without him the humour would turn flat as humour is half execution And the humour is very good in the first place But without Carrey it would kinda feel like a Its a Wonderful Life wannabebr br Jennifer Aniston is great and no matter what some may say does not act like the only excuse for the third act At least you dont think that when you see her She gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget youre watching a movie she and Carrey feel very much like a real couplebr br The movie feels ggooooodd see the movie to understand has a very nice feeling tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save Carreys career which wasnt goin anywhere
0	This movie was poorly written poorly acted and very predictable It was very lowbudget and I can understand why it was never released and went straight to video It wasnt even campy fun it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could get the 112 hours back The colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them br br The plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing what a stretch Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre Just about any movie comes to mind that is better than thisbr br ejames6342
1	This has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen The giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre This unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story The casts is outstanding including TOM BOSLEY who as far as I know never has been in a horror movie before ever The effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one My one complaint I just wish we saw more of the giant mummy but other then that I think they did a great job The dialog the characters and the story was perfect The acting was wonderful This has got to be the best movie to come out of the scifi channel You heard me the best movie to come out of the scifi channel I give THE FALLEN ONES 9 OUT OF 10
1	It was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact Even by todays standards the film is interesting and provocative br br Therese and Isabelle are both attending the same girls school Therese is energetic intelligent and becomes a mentor for the innocent naive sweet Isabelle She guides her through a number of exotic experiences including a trip through an exclusive brothel into her first lesbian liaison and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience br br The film does not exploit any sex nor is there an abundance of nudity The imagery is effective but sometimes the camera lingers too long and the story goes slowly br br The director Radley Metzger went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of Henry Paris He always has extremely detailed stories good acting and very high standards of cinematographybr br Artistically however this is perhaps his most complete His later attempts supplied for entertainment whereas Therese and Isabelle was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism
1	Ive long wanted to see this film being a fan of both Peter Cushing and David McCallum I agree that the romantic subplot was a waste of time but the talent of McCallum shines through this juvie role Thank heavens for Turner Classic which aired the show last week I can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war especially with the way things were throughout the 1950s Some of the boys are a bit scary I certainly wouldnt want to met them on a welllit street much less a dark one There were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well or as they call him a firefly
0	I cant believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny Shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty disgust and stupidity Theres Something About Mary leaves little reason to stay until the end Sure Cameron Diaz is very pretty but that is never going to be enough to save a movie Ben Stiller tries hard to work within the plot and is obviously very talented but the movie is a loserbr br Not once were any of the scenes believable The shots were badly timed and poorly framed The Farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs I check IMDB to see what they are working on just so I know what to avoidbr br 210 the bonus is from the one time I smiled Its not like Im immune to humor or alone in my opinion My wife hated it too The next day we saw Rush Hour and laughed ourselves silly This movie just stunk
0	The first half of this version was the best Ive seen and I think Ive seen every version of Jane Eyre ever made The development of Janes childhood and character were exceptional Then it was as though someone said Uh oh this is running too long and hacked the rest of the story to shreds The major scenes when included at all are glossed over combined and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the storyline There was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow The big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope and then the end dashed it
0	Maybe its the dubbing or maybe its the endless scenes of people crying moaning or otherwise carrying on but I found Europa 51 to be one of the most overwrought and therefore annoying films Ive ever seen The film starts out promisingly if familiarly as mom Ingrid Bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son Sandro Franchina Whilst mummy and daddy bland Alexander Knox entertain their guests at a dinner party the youngster tries to kill himself setting in motion a life changing series of events that find Bergman spending time showering compassion on the poor and needy Spurred on by Communist newspaper editor Andrea Ettore Giannini she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles Bergman plays the saint role to the hilt echoing her 1948 role as Joan of Arc and Rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect Unfortunately the script pounds its point home with hamfisted subtlety as Andrea and Mom take turns declaiming Marxist and Christian platitudes By the final tear soaked scene I had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters A real step down for Rossellini as he stepped away from neorealism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of 1950s Flowers of St Francis
0	Unlike many I dont find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive Its execution however is another matter entirely Like so many Bminus movies all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers For most of the 22orso minutes we sit in waning anticipation any morsel of real humor Or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers With a couple of exceptions the acting is awful the comical overemoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be well suited to a latenight infomercial but not a primetime sitcom even a Canadian one Notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle I cannot help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the CBC to replicate the success of Corner Gas Unfortunately they got the tone and the script completely wrong for the prairies The final insult is that they apparently couldnt even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town Why are they so hard to find in Saskatchewan Did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown Regina exteriors As a proud Canadian I hope this thing goes away soon and that the rest of the world primed by the CBCs publicists quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom
1	Im a huge fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show And I really enjoyed this flick I enjoyed myself here a lot more than I did with other summer blockbustersbr br Its funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like lame plot and its much cruder than the show Does ANYONE remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode Daisy makes incest jokes and Bo says that Luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage The only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slotbr br And as far as the plot goes It was the perfect Dukes plot In fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any TV show that has migrated to the big screenbr br While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville arent EXACTLY like their small screen versions they do a great job and work very well together I wasnt too keen on Burts Boss Hogg though And I would have like a little bit more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe In the movie Roscoe is a little scarybr br And who didnt have a smile on their face as the General Lee is racing through the streets of Atlanta and the back roads of Hazzardbr br Folks allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia bikinis and car chases you wont be sorry Its just a great dumb movie

1	I first saw Thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the Jinn I guess As any kid would be I was delighted with the imagination inventiveness and energy of the film Several years later I realized how much of the satire and wit of the script I had missed on that first viewing I have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years In addition to the script the production transcends the fantasy genre This is Korda the storyteller at his very best When you see Thief as a child you know that youve had a great time When you see Thief as an adult you know that youve seen a masterpiece Its as timeless as the story it treats An amazing workbr br Thomas McCarthy
0	I dont know why this has the fans it does and I dont know why I have even given it the score I have This is preposterous There are many a giallo where one has to suspend disbelief let the picture roll and catch up with it somewhere before it becomes delirious and some poor police officer has to eventually explain what we have seen But this has very little going for it and has overlong sequences where nothing happens and have no relevance to anything while we have to listen to a most repetitive soundtrack even by Italian standards Not a giallo this is a complete mish mash of horror ideas featuring Klaus Kinski in one his most blatant phoned in performances I reckon he turned up did a days work and cleared off leaving Mr DAmato to get others to fill in Ewa is of course pretty but no it is not enough and in the end we have seen far too much of her popping up all over the place long after we have completely lost interest in this mindless and pretentious twaddle Maybe I just wasnt in the right mood
0	Sowe get so see added footage of Brandointeresting but not exactly Oscar worthy stuff Susannah York was hardly a slouch New scene where Lois finds out Clark is Superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesnt notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets Real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget thatlets listen to Donner make fun of Lesters version that made more logical sense The president talks of the Zod defacing the Washington monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore Tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd Supermans freedom of the press line sounded silly compared to Care to step outside which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to Clarks earlier scene in the truck stop Then there is the ending with the turn back the world to go back in time effect It turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for Hackensack NJ ever went since it doesnt free Zod and company any more
0	LL Cool J performed much better in this movie that I expected He did a fabulous job acting as a renegade cop within a renegade department From the very beginning he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament hes in He acts as a sort of gentle giant a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start and he does an amazing job He was quite clearly the best character in the moviebr br This was certainly a performance that will not win Morgan Freeman any awards After starring in powerhouse films like the Shawshank Redemption this film was certainly a step down His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner There are so many ways his character Moses Ashford could have taken a more pivotal role That he didnt was disappointing and a true letdown I was hoping to see more from him in this filmbr br Timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry His portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive This movie is a typical action movie that at least initially bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs LA has experienced in the past Being an action movie it has its share of shootemup scenes blood and guts These scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable Watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end think of what you would typically expect in a goodcopsbadcops conflict and it bears little resemblance to a REAL police shootoutbr br What irked me most was the way Timberlakes character behaved during shootout scenes He starts out having guns and not using them Then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if hes been firing a gun his whole life Then he runs out of bullets and doesnt have a gun and 30 seconds later without moving or anything suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns AND extra ammo Little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for mebr br If what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay then youll probably love this movie Personally it doesnt matter to me what KIND of movie it is as long as it is realistic Make me believe that the story is true This story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that I came away feeling unsatisfied
0	I dont remember a movie where I have cared less about where the characters have come from what happens to them or where they are going I realize that Hollywoods greatest pastime is navelgazing but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take up time with For what its worth though the discussion that followed the showing under the auspices of the Key Sunday Cinema series did make allowance that possibly the three women did show some redeeming characteristics I disagree
1	I saw Saving Grace right after it came out on video Since then its become one of my favorites The plot isnt particularly complex but it doesnt take away from the entertainment Its chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality to it The characters are what makes the movie so good They each have their own quirky qualities which adds to the humor the two old ladies played by Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law leaps to mind Superb acting was done by all particularly Brenda Blythen She and Craig Ferguson were great together in pulling off some of the funnier moments If youre looking for a good comedy Id definately recommend this movie

1	A remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the Women Lawyers Association WLA of Kumba in southwest Cameroon in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence In this Muslim culture where men have always been sovereign over women according to Sharia law one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children After 17 years of failed efforts leaders of the WLA began recently to score a few wins and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious storiesbr br The leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa a state prosecutor and Beatrice Ntuba a senior judge Court President Both play themselves in this film which may contain footage shot spontaneously though I imagine much of it if not all consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera Four cases are reviewed and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the filmbr br Two cases involve repeated wife beating with forcible sex in one case another involves forced sex upon a 10 year old girl and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child age 8 by an aunt One of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce We follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials The outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children The perpetrators receive stiff prison terms andor fines the divorce is grantedbr br The aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed genderneutral when it comes to enforcing the law Also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties including those found guilty are treated This is a highly important and well made film Of interest is the fact that one of the directors Ms Longinotto also codirected the 1998 film Divorce Iranian Style which dealt with related themes in Tehran In broken English with English subtitles My Grade B 810
1	Jeopardy is a tense satisying thriller a cut above a B but not really a major production It qualifies as almost an experimental film as the studio that produced it Metro was desperately looking for new kinds of films stars and directors to compete with the then new medium of television The director John Sturges was an upandcomer whose best years lay ahead He had just recently begun directing A level films and had already proved himself a most capable craftsman Stars Barbara Stanwyck Barry Sullivan and Ralph Meeker were at very different phases of their careers Stanwycks glory years were behind her and yet she could still carry a film as she proves here Barry Sullivan as her husband was one of a dozen or so leading men who got started in films in the forties who never quite achieved the success many had hoped for him He was a fine lowkey actor poised but in an upper middle rather than upper class way which made him excellent in professional roles As the escaped convict who is the only person around who can save Sullivans life he is trapped under a pier and the tide is rising Ralph Meeker is more energetic than usual This excellent actor had the misfortune of having come to films after Brando and Clift He was in his way as good an actor as either of them but he lacked charisma His bargaining with Stanwyck which comes down to his demanding sex in exchange for saving her husband by implication only as this is 1953 makes for an intriguing premise which had this been a different kind of film could all raised all sorts of interesting questions about Stanwycks character Meeker is indeed a more exciting character than Sullivan and in her scenes with him Stanwyck is livelier than she is with her husband and son But as this is a formula picture not a Strindberg play the possibility that Stanwyck might want want to have a flingleaving aside the question of her husbands predicamentremains unexplored In this sense the incoming tide doesnt quite have the effect one might have wished though the movie remains tense and highly entertaining thanks to excellent acting fine location photography nearly all of it outdoors and excellent direction by the woefully underrated Mr Sturges
1	Possible spoilersbr br I recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences Ron Ely is just right as Doc Cool calm almost always in controland with an occasional twinkle in his eye What more can one ask for I have never read a Doc Savage book so I dont know if it is faithful to the source but I enjoyed the light tone and derringdo Many people have compared this movie to Raiders of the Lost Ark which I dont think is fair The difference in budget is astoundingRaiders must have at least 10 times the budget Doc Savage does not have the extensive location work that Raiders has Special effects are also at a minimum but come on people the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right The Sousa music is catchylove that theme song Every time I watch the film I end up humming the theme for daysThe best way to approach this film is to just RELAX and enjoy Highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and Doc chase the Indian sniper throughout the rooftops of New York and the VERY funny fight sequence between Doc and Captain Seas Not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib really Overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day I give it 7 out of 10br br Doc Savage Doc Savagethank the lord hes here
0	Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made The whole plot concerns someone trying to sabotage the superbowl and all the attempts made to stop them How Tom Selleck and Donna Mills careers managed to survive this is beyond me However the most frustrating thing about it was THERE WAS NO FOOTBALL IN IT AT ALL Avoid this one if possible
0	Booted out of heaven a gang of horny naked female angels with big plastic fangs have taken up residence in a spooky forest where they feed upon any hapless souls who should wander by Its not long before a group of friends on a road trip are falling victim to the bloodthirsty babes An independent low budget horror made in the UK Forest of the Damned takes an interesting premise and flushes it down the pan with some of the worst acting effects and direction I have seen in a long timebr br Director Johannes Roberts shows some occasional flair behind the camera  the scenes in the delapidated house are fairly tense and there are some deftly handled shock moments but for the most part the film is technically amateurish Throw in some truly awful performances from horror icons Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson and you have one real bad movie on your handsbr br Some fun may be derived from the films sheer shoddiness and there is loads of female nudity for the guys to savour but most will find this a chore to sit through
1	What happens to washed up rocknroll stars in the late 1990s They launch a comeback reunion tour At least thats what the members of Strange Fruit a fictional 70s stadium rock group dobr br Tony Stephen Rea has the concession on condom vending machines when he runs into the son of the promoter of a famous music festival It was at that festival in the 70s that Strange Fruit broke up The 70s are retro and the time is right to wide that wave He sets off in search of the other members of the bandbr br Part of what broke up the band was the death and replacement of Keith the lead singer and brilliant song writer The band was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all back amongst the working class from which they came Beano the drummer played by Timothy Spall who was brilliant in Secrets and Lies is a layabout the bass player is a roofer and their lead singer is still a rocker While he owns a huge mansion he has been forced to sell it as his fortune has not lasted Brian the lead guitarist is dead so a young guitarist is hired to replace himbr br Somewhat reluctantly the band agree to give the reunion a try Abandoning their day jobs they begin to rehearse and their manager approaches their label about reissuing their albums But he wants them to start touring again first And so they hit the club circuit around Europe The club scene is not kind to these overweight dated old rockersbr br It is on tour that the film really starts to develop All of the old conflicts rearise with the figures of Keith and Brian hovering throughout They all hang together because they are all in search of a second chance for the greatness that eluded them earlier And they rediscover some of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so enjoyablebr br Still Crazy starts as Spinal Tap II but gradually becomes a more dramatically focused film following the relationships of the band members While it is still a very funny movie it is the evolving characters struggling to deal with the deaths of Brian and Keith and with their own personal demons that make the film work
1	The problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the 60screated concept that comic books could only be done as camp ie the 60s Batman show for TV and movie Thus you have combat sequences with subtitles come on a cluelessly unromantic Doc Savage he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps not an idiot Monk Mayfair in a nightsheet a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a Herve Villechez posing for an Oscar statute And when theyre not doing booming Sousa march scores the tinkly little funny music undercuts much of the dramabr br Even as such this movie isokay Its fun and when it stays serious its a very accurate representation of the pulps Except for Monk as has been mentioned before hes hugely muscled not obese And Long Tom who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude not Paul Gleason with an inexplicable scarfbr br The Green Death sequences for instance are remarkably gruesome and not something Id recommend for children But they are very close to the feel of the pulps When the writers and producers get it right they do get it right Ill give them thatbr br But if the producers had done Doc with the loving care and scripting of say Reeves first two Superman movies think what we might have had then I think the problem is the movies schizophrenic Theres a definite sense of trying to do a 30s homage but theyre also trying to give in to the heroes must be camp attitude that Batman created One gets the impression there was a sober pulpstyle first draft and then someone came in and said Hey lets make it funny it worked with the Batman show 8 years agobr br But Doc lives on thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai If MacRauch aint doing a homage to Doc Savage in that movie the man is truly demented So when the series actually gets on TV allegedly midseason in 9900 Doc Savage updated to the 90s will live once more
0	Im not alone in admiring the first Superman movie a film that Richard Donner executed masterfully I am also not alone in scorning Richard Lesters Superman 2 which brings us to the Richard Donner cut of the same movie sadly it is still an absolute abominationbr br Supermans world is one where suspension of disbelief is required in strong doses but Superman 2 stretches things too far It doesnt matter who directed Superman 2 because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader In a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do unlike the original superman With or without his powers Supermans strength or lack thereof is handled in the least believable manner There is too much to criticize so I will not bother I condemn this movie perhaps the slapstick in the Lester version is more appropriate to the moronic script this movie is based on SuperDuper bad
1	This movie should not be compared to The Sting or other caperheistcon game films What makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships deceit and trust Its also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale Has Mr Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy Highly hugely recommended
1	Does anyone know the exact quote about time and love by George Ede aka Father Fitzpatrick in the move It had to be you He was talking to Charlie and Annna in the church as they were leaving If not I will have to rent the movie This was a great movie I also loved Serendipity Great love story for the soul br br I met my one true love my Soulmate and although I had the experience to meet him when I had least expecting it I wasnt ready for that kind of emotional relationship br br Altho we did marry I wasnt mature enough to give as much as I thought I would I got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for 7 years br br He finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry in disbelief about the way it turned out I had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart 3 yearsbr br This movie meant a lot because I am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love I can NOW appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of Father Fitzpatrick rang true for mebr br I know when he has healed enough to trust me again we will remarrybr br Dont EVER GET COMPLACENT AND TAKE TRUE LOVE FOR GRANTED IT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST LESSON OF MY LIFE br br Also the music in this movie is OUTSTANDING and MEANINGFUL This movie is DEEP and spiritually uplifting TRUE LOVE is worth waiting for if it is meant to be it will no matter what IT WILL HAPPEN Nothing is impossible even when its the second time around Thanks

1	This film was one of my childhood favorites and I must say that unlike some other films I liked in that period The Thief of Bagdad has held on to its quality while I grew up This is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well The only drawback there is is that one can not see past the bad effects compared to the effects nowadays like one could when one was a child I remembered nothing of those effects of course it had been about ten years since Id seen this film when I was about eleven years old Who then watches effects One only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides In my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century Coming to think of it I feel like the Indiana Jones films are quite a like this film There is comedy romance and adventure all in one which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern it succeeds in not being dusty and old All of that is mainly due to the great story the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors In that department Sabu as Abu and Conrad Veidt as Jaffar stand out providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part Great film and although an oldie definitely a goldie I hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on DVD somedaybr br 8 out of 10
0	The math aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this TV show apart from the millions of other cop shows The only redeeming aspect to this show is Rob Morrow although his career must have been undeservedly waning after Northern Exposure if he signed up for this schlockbr br The lameness of the math aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode costarring Lou Diamond Phillips which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned In order to catch a fugitive the mathematician uses some theory about bubbles So he gives this long explanation that if we have seen the suspect in places A B and C then we can use bubble theory to calculate where he might be He does this all on a chalkboard or maybe with a stick in the dirt I cant rememberbr br Anyway when you look at the finished product he basically took three spots and picked a point right in the middle and said Ok mathematically heres where we are most likely to find the fugitive At which point one other character points out Oh that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live Is that math Its not even connectthefkgdots This show reminds me of the math major I used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to support points that every one else had already agreed on through either lesscomplex analysis or basic common sensebr br It just goes to show When youre a hammer everything looks like a nail I cant wait til they stick the NUMB3RS team on OSAMA Theyll use calculus call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains and hit Osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields cuz hey its all about the numbersbr br Totally ludicrous TV show
0	Im a fan of arty movies but regretfully I have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel Agonisingly slow to develop a nonexistent plot based on a promising premise the experience is shall we say trying Even after bad movies I feel that I learn something or enjoyed some aspect but there there was nothing to appreciate The premise was not uninteresting but the movie starts and ends there The acting was OK though the characters were utterly boring For the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal she is mightily empty Pity I usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content
1	This film takes you to another time when there was a different pace to everyday life We get an idea how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men off to fight A very touching look at the past and a reminder that casualties of war dont just happen on the frontbr br Luckily many of us have never had to go through what our greatgrandparents grandparents or parents went through during a war This film I think is a small thank you Peter Outerbridge looks amazingly like a young Peter OToole and Russell Crowe is absolutely charming and as Australian as he can be Its definitely worth listening to him recite High Flight and makes me wonder what he might accomplish with Shakespeare
1	There are a few spoilers in this commentbr br Contrary to the comments I just read by nativetex4u and a few others I really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly seriesbr br I am a Judson Mills fan but also a huge Chuck Norris fan and while Ill admit that a few of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little the storyline fit right in with other weekly series that are currently being airedbr br The opening fifteen minutes with Deke running from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very action packed I do fail to see how that many professionals werent able to hit a moving target but the action was definitely there and Deke being the hero had to survivebr br As for the comment about needing to get the movie in the can to fill the time slot after the playoffs This movie was not originally scheduled by CBS for a January airing and filming was completed in May of 2001 a good 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the USbr br If the writer of the comment had been paying attention to the movie instead of trying to avoid it maybe they would have realized the plot of the story Rashid a Bin Laden like character planned to set off a nuclear device in the United States The Presidents Man was called in to locate and eliminate the problembr br Perhaps the writer should actually WATCH the movie before attempting to comment on itbr br
0	Well I can once and for all put an end to the question What is the worst movie ever madeever It is Flight of Fury starring and cowritten by Steven Seagal Sure there are lots of famously bad movies but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriouslybr br It is a Romanianmade film that speaks to just how far Romania has to go to catch up with Bollywood It also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent Steven Seagal has become This movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry knowing that nothing will make you feel clean againbr br It was released only on video I cant imagine why and I suspect the workers that had to make the DVDs had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling
0	This movie is a terrible waste of time Although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to 4 I have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose This is also a horror film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight My friend and I laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scaredbr br The only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries It cannot be that high in demand br br The supermodel Nicole Petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie half of the time she is British and half the time she is American
0	I spent almost two hours watching a movie that I thought with all the good actors in it would be worth watching I couldnt believe it when the movie ended and I had absolutely no idea what had happenedI was mad because I could have used that time doing something elseI tried to figure it all out but really had no clue Thanks to those who figured it out and have explained itright or wrong its better than not knowing anything Who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away How did First Lady know that her husband was cheating on her At the end of the movie Kate said she would eventually find out the truth Does this mean that were going to be subjected to End Game 2
0	What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking Was Hollywood responsible for this travesty or can I take comfort in the idea that someone who didnt speak English as a first language just completely missed the point of Charlotte Brontes classic I dont think I can improve on a comment I read below so Ill just paraphrase it Jane Eyre is a great great book the screenwriter should read it sometime Its true that this movies two leads were sadly miscast But pity the actors because the screenwriter left out all of the best scenes The dialog that makes you understand the Jane and Rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fundeleted from the script The marriage proposal the fortune tellergone The allusions half joking half sincerely felt to Jane as a fairy sprite from olde England come to rescue Rochester in his despaireliminatedbr br It is unfortunate that Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and Janes interactions with the Rivers family But it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love from one of the best love stories ever writtenbr br Do yourself a favor and go find the 1983 mini series with Timothy Dalton
0	Just a few words This movie really sucks Its like those TV Movies with bad cast and plot Its amazing how they could make this sequel worse than the III Dont waste your time watching this crap even if you like the tremors movies
0	The Minion is about well a minion A servant of Satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped He is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another Anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas a member of a secret order of Templars who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion The movie begins a thousand years ago in the Middle East where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion Then flash forward to 1999 where the key winds up somewhere underground in New York An archeologist is assigned to studydig the place where the key was found Needless to say the minion is after the key and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and Lukas and archeologistbr br The movie is just that a low budget Bmovie flick The movie lacks energy and just trods along Youll follow the chase but you wont ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies especially The Terminator films The fight scenes with the minion is troublesome in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is It skillfully becomes a oneman army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to oneon one And its supposed to be around for a long time All this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience The whole idea of a secret order of Templars a door to hell and the key isnt well explained We are merely to accept that they just exist The movie seems to have been made with the feeling theres not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks Dolph Lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere elsebr br The verdict 2 of 5 stars
0	The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes Kor a holocaust survivor part of Mengeles experiments on twins consisting primarily her version of what happened at Auschwitz and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments The movie obviously had great reviews Its one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion aboutbr br I too for a large part of the movie got sucked into the emotion that the moviemaker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on One of the user reviews on IMDb by Eric Monder obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum could only find the sweetest nectar In one of the many dramatic sequences as a group of Jews argue with Kor at a Jewish center the meaning of the word forgive is even debated but the isolated and outnumbered Kor holds her own But by this time the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that I could see clearly once more After the strongwilled Eva Kor forgives her Nazi captors the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about at least from the viewpoint of Kor The movie goes about following her past her public statement forgiving the Nazis and into new territory To me this was the meat of the movie surrounded by inedible fat of her act of forgiveness Obviously it was a very sick cowbr br On a mission to test her theory of forgiveness in order to heal wounds of the past she makes her way to the promised land to meet with some Arabs to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with Jews in the US on her act of forgiving the Nazis including one at a Jewish center in Chicago From then on anyone not so teary eyed that they cant see the screen will find it hardpressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statementsbr br Firstly you immediately notice her body language defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of Arab scholars and teachers Her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time effort and money the entire act was A rather annoyed Dr Sami Advan Professor of education at Bethlehem University gets it just right when he tells Kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartmentbr br Finally the debate at the Jewish center in Chicago where she is grilled on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the actsbr br I will cut to the chase By the end of the movie I was hoping I hadnt chosen to watch the movie The movie was badly made failing to delve deeper into anything about Auschwitz apart from the purely trivial just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears It showed that Kor the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion Her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness at best to a complete unwillingness to listen or participatebr br Lastly is everyone so retarded today that they cant notice the difference between making peace and forgiving Quoting another IMDb user I dont see her forgiveness as being weak quite the contrary she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul she wanted the suffering to be over so she let it go That would be the perfect laymans definition of MAKING PEACEbr br I guess in a world of propaganda blind faith and political correctness there is no room to question those that have gone through more than the human mind can fathombr br PS The dictionary certainly should go into all those Bookstobuy lists everyone keeps making
0	Camera work Why is the camera work in this movie so jumpy This is annoying and distracting Editing the Flashes of the still pictures were way too short Many of the other scenes were too short also Just flashes Sound the background music was way too loud and covered up the voices One should not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said Doesnt anybody check these things and make them do it over again Please reduce the volume of the background music in future Is adjustment of the relative sound levels the job of the editor Julia Wong The plot had way too many loose ends The basic story line had potential I think the film needed more work Was it rushed Perhaps they ran out of money Like a lot of movies it started out great but just petered out toward the end I really dont understand this you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why doesnt all the loose ends get taken care of in the storyboardbr br Sorry to be so critical

0	We all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books While not particularly accurate adaptations these movies were nonetheless excellent films Some great examples are the Harry Potter series the Lord of the Rings trilogy and to a lesser extent almost every Disney film ever made However I must regretfully announce that A Wrinkle in Time is not one of those movies Not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of Madeleine LEngles fan base it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting acting special effects and ultimately respect for the audience Mind you Im not trying to be mean on the contrary I went into this affair with an open mind I figured that a madeforTV movie would make up for its lack of razzledazzle in its script After all the Star Wars spinoff Ewoks was decent if a little silly Come to think of it the original Star Wars was made on a lunch money budget and look where it took George Lucas However from the first scene onward disappointment started enveloping me as if Id gotten too close to the Black Thing while tessering br br The same way Greedo shooting first became the symbol of the Star Wars Special Edition of 1997 a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic Mrs Whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is A Wrinkle in Time The reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief Aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting Alfre Woodard Star Trek First Contact and Radio as our favorite starturnedmentor the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow Thats right a crow Moreover the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eightyearold the majestic halfman halfhorse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle Had I been five this would have psychologically traumatized me for life The worst part is the fact that when it spoke it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single unmoving cheek thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than ETbr br Having gotten the most painful part out of the way I must go on to the tearinducing one the characters the acting and the story I personally had always imagined Meg to look somewhat similar to Moaning Myrtle from the Harry Potter films plain hair glasses and a figure most supermodels would find laughable She was always a slightly anxious humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of Nicaragua In the film she is an unpleasant knowitall for whom I have no sympathy whatsoever In fact she makes me feel sorry for poor Mr Jenkins her school principal who continuously has to deal with her Calvin the kind intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has become a jock The irony is horrible As for the memorable Happy Medium they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is above gender and likes to look at funny things such as girls falling off of swings The only three people I can think of who did a decent job are Charles Wallace Mrs Whatsit and the Man With Red Eyes nicknamed the Dude With Red Eyes due to his complete reinvention as a characterbr br The story is a mess A good comparison to this aspect of the movie is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban which didnt do a good job of retelling the story found in the book yet kept the sole of the original work Here the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with Hades down in the underworld apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed As the Dark Lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen the flatnosed wookies of Ixchel who replace the wondrous beings who hold Aunt Beast among their ranks tear the spine up As the God of the Dead notes how subtle the terror of the Earthlike Camazotz was the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil br br I am very sorry that this film exists I do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad Its the way the characters are written that ruins it A Wrinkle in Time deserved to be adapted by Lawrence Kasdan directed by George Lucas or Steven Spielberg enhanced at Industrial Light and Magic scored by John Williams given its sound at Skywalker Sound edited by THX and marketed by Twentieth Century Fox In its current state the film is unworthy to be shown to selfrespecting people Even Madeleine LEngle thought it was bad The book was Good the film was Bad and Mrs Whatsit was Uglybr br Score 0110 If I could br br Prosbr br They got the names right br br Cons br br It had horrible problems with the Cliffs Notes level of adaptation script acting and special effects not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book Oh and the main coverposter has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle Some might say that this symbolizes high adventure I say it

0	Steven Seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in closeup to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources To pick on the technical flaws silver FA18s and F14s take of from a carrier for an airstrike and miraculously become camouflaged F16s for the actual strike would give this movie more credibility than it deserves Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe which presumably is available to all users of Final Cut Pro Putting all your creativity into your own credit puts Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu

0	I was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in North Carolina Instead I watched a man who rues the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the Duke family And this went on and on If Mr McElwees family had prevailed over the Dukes I doubt that Mr McElwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobaccorelated diseases I grew up near the area where Mr McElwees family began it tobacco business I expected more than McEwees continual focus on his family I learned very little about the history of tobacco in the NC economy and the ramifications to the states economy by tighter regulation of tobacco The countless references to the movie Bright Leaves are out of place So what if Gary Cooper played Mr McElwees great grandfather Does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by the showing of old film clips of a fictionalized film I didnt
0	Without a doubt this is one of the worst films Ive ever wasted money on The plot is erm sorry did I say there was a plot The scariest moment was when nope cant think of one The best special effect that had me hiding under the bed covers was nope cant think of one for that either You knew who the killer was right from the start There was nothing scary about the whole movie in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister Misty in the shower and when you saw Nurse Toppan take her top off This film should only be watched to get an idea of how NOT to make a horror movie
0	I just saw this at the Venice Film Festival and cant quite decide about it We were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them Maybe that was the point that we are all in a bubble of our own but these people didnt compel me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various fates At a running time of just over an hour the characters werent very well developed Lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment forklifts conveyor belts shovels and the slightlycreepylooking baby dolls with surprisingly lifelike eyes that most of the characters made for a living were somehow more interesting than the live people An interesting experiment but somehow it never quite came together
1	I laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt Ben Affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy Jack Black in this role Gandolfini gives his typical A performance The entire cast is funny the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome I went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why I was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy can identify with loneliness during the holidays andor putting up with the relatives The best part to this film to me anyway were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped Namely the scene involving the lighting of the Christmas tree Go see it and have a good laugh

1	I have to agree with MR Caruso Jr Lanzas was the finest voice god had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go for broke leave Hollywood and head for the opera he could have been the American Caruso everyone says he could have been but in any case he is a fantastic introduction to the art form no bones about it and if thats the way its gonna be so be it see the film youll see why Mr Lanza still come up in discussion even in my house Someone says Pavarotti i say MARIO LANZAAs for the film itself when will it be on DVD they must have it restored and VHS isnt good enough but this should also be the only Lanza film put on DVD the others are down right bad and boring
1	This movie is not about entertainment or not even a movie you want to see to pass the time This movie is a genuinely a display of true love that can only come from God One cannot help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie We have several dimensions of love that contributes to the value of this movie There is the divine love of God that is beautifully portrayed Gods love transcends the heart and mind and endures and is eternal There is the love in a marriage While the main character grapples with his wifes disease he realizes through Gods love that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine He knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated Finally you have the love of child and parent The kids in the family come together and realize that nothing else matters except that love conquers fear Dear friends love is not love unless it comes from God because God is love and love comes from God Talk to someone and let them know you love them Love does no good unless it is given to another I pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it Amen

0	I just watched The Convent for the second time I had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken Friday night film some gore some style bit of humour and suchlike I was saddened to find that I could no longer appreciate it much It seemed like someone had set out to revisit cheeseball epics like Night of the Demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile For the record Im not even a huge fan of Night of the Demons but there were some things I really dug about it The Convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much Apart from the main girl likeable performance from Joanna Canton the goth girl and a sweet cameo from Adrienne Barbeau pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable festering at the absolute lowest levels of moronic offensive jockhood The film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that given the awful dialogue it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film The evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes though not scary their certainly kinda cool and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore Towards the end when Adrienne Barbeau is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining cause all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy The stylised direction also occasionally yields good results although sometimes the camera just moves too fast All in all this was a film where for me the shining good points just cant make up for the things I hated Those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more but for me it wasnt a good time

0	As if the storyline wasnt depressing enough this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher Weird stuff Then theres the core premise of the heroheroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a hes besotten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl Is this person a psycho a masochist just a doomed queen who takes things too far And what sort of traumatic childhood did he have Just that he didnt get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly He tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did but its really really so hard to empathize Such sad and unusual self destruction Was it supposed to be funny What was it all about really

0	This was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life It was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous And i have never seen such bad acting in my life The only good part about the movie were all the hot guysespecially Drew Fuller I dont know what these people were thinking when they made this movie I didnt even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves I mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn I would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch I was very disappointed The whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion
0	I notice that the previous reviewer who appears to be still at school gave this movie a very good review and I can only assume that this is because the reviewer hasnt seen the far superior 1989 BBC adaptation of this classic novel The major problem I had with this 1999 version was the casting of Anthony Way as Tom Long Anthony Way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the TV miniseries The Choir I can only assume that he was cast for the role of Tom Long on the strength of his excellent acting in The Choir Unfortunately the small boy who appeared in The Choir had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time Toms Midnight Garden was filmed and as such Anthony fails to convince as schoolboy Tom It is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that Tom as played by Anthony would befriend the far younger Hatty In the 1989 BBC version Tom and Hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable For a 1999 movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the 1989 TV effects The casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic As a final observation I would point out that the VHS of the 1989 BBC version fetches well over £2000 second hand whereas a new DVD of this version can be bought for under £500 need I say more

1	Uneven Bollywood drama Karisma Kapoor is excellent as an Indian woman in Canada who marries a friend Sanjay Kapoor has a child and then visits his family in India only to find they are terrorist warlords Drama and tragedy ensue and the film becomes a kind of NOT WITHOUT MY BABY styled thriller Film is compelling its few songdance numbers are uninteresting and needless the gaity of Bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this films drama at least once weve left the comforting confines of their Canadian love nest  although one number involving a cameo by the stunning Aishwarya Rai is enjoyably provocative if ultimately misplaced as well Likewise the inclusion of Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan as a happygolucky drifter who helps Kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce and it only gets back on his feet when his character  and his fantasies about Rai that generate her cameo dance  are dispensed with His throwaway comicbook dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the films primary gripping drama The cast is nicely supported by Nana Patekar as the warlord and the elegant Deepti Naval who is outstanding as his longsuffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the films best scenes Ritu Shivpuri and Rajshree Solanki are also very good as Sanjays sisters in India and very pleasing eye candy But Sanjay himself overacts terribly especially during obvious adlibs The directorial style of writerdirector Krishna Wamsi is sloppy rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts although his camera movement is good The musical underscore is also quite effective moody featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble too bad little if any of that made it onto SHAKTIs soundtrack cd but Bollywood hasnt yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums at least not in most cases But SHAKTI is Karisma Kapoors film all the way though and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to India contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with Sanjay in the initial Canadian scenes Despite the unevenness of much of the picture Karismas performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures In a strange way also I found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty Id noticed in CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER and MARIE ANTOINETTE both of which Id seen just prior although SHAKTI of course is an entirely different kind of film but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family  here living in the austerity of terrorismcontrolled poverty in India rather than the elegance of Versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal Chinas Tang Dynasty  whose selfserving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext

1	or type on a computer keyboard theyd probably give this eponymous film a rating of 10 After all no elephants are shown being killed during the movie it is not even implied that any are hurt To the contrary the master of ELEPHANT WALK John Wiley Peter Finch complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachydermsno matter how menacingwithout a permit from the government and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability Furthermore the elements conspirein the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemicto leave the Wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the Elephant People as the natives dub them to close the story If you happen to see the current release EARTH youll detect the Elephant People are faring less well today
1	This was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption I loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family Wellacted and welldirected If there were any flaws Id have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again What about all people of all cultural backgrounds I would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown like in real life Nevertheless the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker Loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes

1	The only time I have seen this movie was when I was 10 years old I have remembered it all of these years as I couldnt sleep for a week or more after seeing it It just absolutely rattled me I was on vacation with my aunts in Ft Worth Texas and I will never forget it Now 48 years later my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to view as an adult It has taken a lot of research to find out what movie it was but I always remembered that Barbara Stanwyck was in it and finally was able to get the name and reviews on it I very much enjoyed it but it gave me quite a scare Jaqui
1	I had few problems with this film and I have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated True it is over three hours long but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly I dont think it is overrated at all I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent The film looks sumptuous with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose David Warner a great actor steals every scene hes in The story is very rich in detail and is hot on character development obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow The last hour is extremely riveting and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat when the Titanic sank I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving The music score by James Horner was lovely though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On The 1996 miniseries was good but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies Overall I give Titanic an 8510 Bethany Cox
0	This film has to be the worst I have ever seen The title of the film deceives the audience into thinking there maybe hope The story line of the film is laughable at best with the acting so poor you just have to cringe The title Zombie Nation implies a hoard of zombies when in fact there are six in total This cannot be categorised as a horror film due to the introduction of cheesy 80s music when the zombies attack The zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film with the only difference being the make up which looks like something out a La Roux video If you ever get the chance to buy this film then do so then burn the copy
1	A slight charming little movie to be sure but a superblycrafted one Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this early showcase for her British accent and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue This came out around the time of Sense and Sensibility and Im sure I dont know why that one garnered all the Oscar attention Emma is Jane Austens most accessible and least stuffy story told well
0	This movie had me going The title was perhaps the greatest idea that I heard I thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the US and a group of lone survivors band together and plan to take out the zombies DEAD WRONG Its about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female arrests gets whats coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge As you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved Where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nationbr br First off the zombie women look like Victoria Secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face What are zombies but mindless debatable intelligent cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs These zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies Sure the eating and killing is there but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement Although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre it makes fun of that genre and asks the question why cant zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines I would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies I would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much its an insult and as for scary not even
0	By 1941 Columbia was a fullfledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as MGM Paramount or Warners Thats the best thing that could be said about Adam Had Four Sons a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by Ingrid Bergman topbilled for the first time in an American film and Warner Baxter Bergman plays a Frenchwoman this was the era in which Hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another hired as governess to Baxters four sons and staying on with one interruption caused by the stockmarket crash of 1907 until the boys are grown men serving in World War I Just about everyone in the movie is so goodygood its a relief when Susan Hayward as the villainess enters midway through  shes about the only watchable person in the movie even though shes clearly channeling Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh its also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles  but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous No wonder Bergman turned down the similarly plotted The Valley of Decision four years later
1	I found this movie to be suspenseful almost from the getgo When Miss Stanwyck starts her narration its only a few minutes until you realize that trouble is coming The deserted area the lock on the deserted gas station door everything sets you up to wait for ithere it comes At first you think it will be about the little boy but all too soon you start holding your breath watching the tide coming in I found this movie to be really stressful even though I had watched it before and was prepared for the denouement Now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you have seen it before deserves some sort of special rating maybe a white knuckles award
1	Directed by Govind Nihalani this is definite cop film of Indian cinema May be the first one which portrayed the stark reality of corruption in the police force politics with no holds barred how it effects on a young cop A man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father Agreed that we grew up watching lot of good copbad cop Hindi films but this is different Todays generation which grown up watching dark realistic films like Satya Company may be consider it inferior product in comparison but look at the time of its making The film was made absolutely off beat tone in the time when people didnt pay much attention to such kind of cinema yet it becomes a most sought after cop film in class mass audience when it released For Om Puri its first breakthrough in mainstream Hindi cinema he delivered a class performance as Inspector Velankar Its more than cop character he internalized a lot which is something original in acting Watch his scenes with his father whom he hates Smita whom he loves Smita Patil maintained the dignity of her character to the expected level My God what a natural expressions she carried Shafi Inamdar was truly a discovery for me hes a brilliant character actor if given a chance here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even Om The movie is also a debut of a promising villain on Indian screen Sadashiv Amrapurkar as Rama Shetty Its another story that he didnt get such a meaty role almost forgotten today as one of the loud villain of Dharmendras B grade action films Watch the scene where Om 1st time becomes a rebel for his father played by Amrish Puri next both are sharing wine together How inner truth started revealing for both the character with confronting feelings of love hate for each other Two faces of Indian Police Force Masculinity Impotency and in between lies half truth ardh satya Kudos to Nihalanis touch The film won 2 National Awards as Best Hindi Feature Film Best Actor Om Puri 3 Filmfare Awards in Best Film Best Director Best Supporting Actor Categories br br Recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious Hindi filmsbr br Ratings 810
1	I have a feeling that the Warners Bros Depressionera musicals are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of years Yes we are in the economic doldrums or have you been living under a rock and times look bleak But we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles In the 30s filmgoing was hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom Footlight Parade 1933 was one such film that audiences flocked to While this Lloyd Bacondirected musical doesnt quite capture the social issues of the time as Gold Diggers of 1933 1933 does its still a wonderful showcase of talent We have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece Busby Berkely extravaganza numbers but boy are they worth waiting for me Yes little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress and her tapping is soso but Busbys magical By A Waterfall whisks her and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls into a dizzying water wonderland Of course Busbys numbers could never really be performed on a stage they defy limits of gravity for one thing and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough wisecracking nonmusical scenes And Footlight also has James Cagney in at the one of his alltoofew musicals really what couldnt this man do He even gets to take over from the leading man don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot Shanghai Lil who is really little Ruby in Chinagirl wigHe costars with Joan Blondell his adorable adoring secretary who Cagney somehow overlooks in favour of other women until the final reel that is Apparently Blondell was the only other woman who Cagney loved apart from his wife And you can see the mutual adoration in every scene
0	My dad is a fan of Columbo and I had always disliked the show I always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is But he goes on watching it none the less That is his right as an American I guess But my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that Spielberg had directed the premier episode It was then that I was thankful that my dad had bought this show that I really cant stand I went through his DVD collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college My opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed but I did gain respect for Spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors And that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along get the pun HAHA Like Spielberg did Its like Jesus before he became a man Or thats at least what I think that would feel like Any ways if your fan of Columbo than you would most likely like this even though it contains little of Peter Falk I attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet This episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of Columbos investigation as many later episodes would do
1	After Aakrosh this was the second film for Govind Nihalani as a directorTill this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in IndiaThis movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence It was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released This movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood likeCOOLIE BETAABHERO in 1983br br SmithaPatel in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him She was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubsAt one timeshe even gave up her love when the heros ruthlessness touched the roof topbr br There was another character in this movie which was played by Om Puri contemporary Naseeruddin ShahHe played as an inspectorturnedalcoholic characterThe role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the heros endingbr br In his debut filmSadashiv Amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfareThe cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent The anger which left half handedly continued in Govind Nihalanis other film Drohkaal Even after two decades this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew Each one played their part par excellence
1	I rented this for my son who is recently found interest in 911 He was a Kindergartener at the time and had no idea what was unfolding I liked the way it was told as a documentary If there was one movie that I would recommend to see concerning 911 this would be THE one Normally you see a movie it has actors that are well known This movie had nobody known Also you see a movie concerning 911 you hear about a firefighter or two losing their lives saving people I didnt feel this had any of that I only rented this movie and would definitely consider adding it to my collection Very well done indeed My heart goes out to the survivors and families of victims of 911

0	I had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novelso invariably my expectations were crushed But they were crushed more than should be expected The movie would have been a decent movie if I had not read the novel beforehand which perhaps ruined it for mebr br In any event for some reason they changed the labor camp at Toulon to a ship full of galley slaves The scene at Bishop Myriels was fine In fact other than the galleys things survived up until the dismissal of Fantine Because we do not want to have bad things happen to a good woman she does not cut her hair sell her teeth or become a prostitute The worst she does is run into the mayors office and spit on his face Bamatabois is entirely eliminated Because having children out of wedlock should also not be talked about Tholomyes is Fantines dead husband rather than an irresponsible dandy Valjean is able to fetch Cosette for Fantine before the Champmathieu affair so they reunite happily yet another change Then comes the convent which is a pretty difficult scene to screw up Thankfully it was saved After this three minutes of accuracy however the movie again begins to hurtle towards Classic Novel Butcheringbr br As Cosette and Valjean are riding through the park they come across Marius giving a speech at a meeting About prison reform When he comes to hand out fliers to Valjean and Cosette he says the one line in the movie that set me screaming at the TV set We arent revolutionaries I could hear Victor Hugo thrashing in his grave OF COURSE THEY ARE REVOLUTIONARIES They want to revolt against the pseudomonarchy that is in place in favor of another republic you dumb screenwriters Its a historical FACT that there was an insurrection against the government in 1832 br br At one point Cosette goes to give Marius a donation from her father for the reform movement and meets Eponine Exceptnot Eponine Or at least not the Eponine of the book This Eponine appears to be a welltodo secretary girl working for the prison reformers who are working out of the Cafe Universal as opposed to the Cafe Musain Not to mention the audience is already made to dislike her thanks to her notperiod lowcut tightfitting dress and her snooty mannerismsbr br The prison reformers Lead by the most poorly cast Enjolras that I have EVER seen decide that handing out pamphlets isnt good enough anymore So theyre going to build barricades I dont know about you but I have never heard of reform movements tearing up the streets and building barricades and attacking government troops About three hundred people it was not supposed to be so many start attacking the National Guard and building a bunch of barricades etc Eponine does die for Marius thankfully br br The rest of the movie is sort of accurate except that Javerts suicide again seems hard to understand thanks to his minuscule screen time and odd character interpretation The movie ends with Valjean watching Javert jump into the river This is again inaccurate because Valjean would never have let Javert drown He saved the mans life earlier why let him die now Then theres the whole skipping of Valjeans confession to Marius his deterioration and his redemption on his deathbed with Marius and Cosette by his sidebr br Overall I can blame the script mostly for the problems While I am glad Enjolras and Eponine were at least present in the film they were terribly misinterpreted as was the entire barricade scene The elimination of Fantines suffering prevents us from feeling too much pity for her That Cosette knows Valjeans past from the start messes with the plot a good deal I did not even see Thenardier and Mme Thenardier only had a few seconds of screen time The same with Gavroche I did like Frederich Marchs interpretation of Valjean a lot however which was one of the redeeming features of the movie On the other hand Charles Laughton for all his great acting in other movies seems to have missed the mark with Javert The lip tremble the unnecessary shouting and his acting in general all just felt very wrong He also like many Javerts I have seen did not appear at all menacing something required of the characterbr br Again this film would probably feel much better if I had not read the book I would not recommend it to book purists though I would also say that the movie would have been a good adaptation for the time had not the infamously accurate French version come out the year before
0	Following the appalling Attack Force chances were that Seagal could only have a step up with Flight Of Fury To outstink Attack Force would take some doing Flight Of Fury is a marked improvement overall but still in the grand scheme of thinks mediocre Mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for Seagal these days a sad insight into his movie careers decline Where Attack Force was a hodgepodge of plot lines altered drastically from conception to filming to post production Flight Of Fury keeps the plot line more simple Someone steals a hightech stealth fighter planning to use it to fire chemical weapons which we later bizarrely discover will destroy the whole world in 48 hrs Seagal has to get the plane back Its that simple no annoying subplots and conspiracies weighing the film down like far too many of his recent works Thats not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though its pretty poor The introduction to side characters is badly done for examplebr br In filmic terms FOF is bad Its badly acted by all involved and Seagal looks bored to tears almost Hes just got the look of a toddler whos been forced to perform the school nativity against his will and so performs with a constant grimace and air of half assedness Can we blame Seagal though when the material is so unambitious and cruddy Not really This is the final film of his Castel Studios multipicture deal The producers cant be bothered to make anything remotely good promising a 12 or so million dollar budget and after Seagals obligatory 5 million probably pocketing a nice hefty chunk of it themselves If the film was made for the remaining 7 million then Im Elvis Pressley So in that respect why should Seagal put the effort into a film thats already got distribution sorted before its made Fans though may argue he at least owes them the effort Hes seriously looking jaded and the continued use of stand ins and dubovers is further indication of this Michael Keusch directs with some efficiency while the cinematography is quite good but in all technical areas and as usual with Castel a bog standard stunt team theres nothing more than mediocrity and nothing to help the film rise above its material and bored leading man Again theres a few action scenes focusing on characters other than Seagal which in all truth we dont want to seebr br Overall the action isnt too bad Its nice and violent and on occasion were treated to a few vintage nasty Seagal beatings but overall nothing special Partly due to a poor stunt crew and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting For me Shadow Man was a more enjoyable film because while ignoring the incoherent jumbled plot line there were more vintage Seagal moments and more of him in centre stage He never disappeared for long periods during the film Seagal disappears bizarrely during one action scene here and reappears after with little explanation Theres far too much stock footage used Using stock shots isnt an entirely horrendous thing but using it as a crutch is Were treated to countless establishing shots of naval ships all the time which get annoying Plus the continuity of the stock footage is all over the place just check the backdrops chopping and changingbr br The film is just middle of the road It says it all that the films best scene is a completely needless and gratuitous girl on girl scene with two hot chicks Seagal even perks up briefly then too Overall this may be one of the better stock footage based actioners out there but thats not saying much at all This will please many fans but they should bear in mind Seagal himself would probably want to forget this ones existence

1	I have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm happy feeling I felt as if I had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time I thoroughly enjoyed this film The acting was superb although I would have to mention Bill Nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance Bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance And Billy Connolly as always totally gorgeous It was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned Such a refreshing experience to see a wellwritten superbly acted and goodlooking movie
1	I LOVE this show its sure to be a winner Jessica Alba does a great job its about time we have a kickass girl whos not the cutesy type The entire cast is wonderful and all the episopes have good plots Everything is layed out well and thought over To put it together must have taken a while because it wasnt someone in a hurry that just slapped something together Its a GREAT show altogether

1	THE GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at Radio City Music Hall in a year when most movergoers were stayathomes watching their new 7 Motorola televisions Almost all recent box office figures are false because they fail to adjust inflation Obviously todays 10 movies will dominate In 1951 it cost 90c to 160 at Radio City 44c to 75c first run at Loews Palace in Washington DC or 35c to 50c in neighborhood runs What counts is the number of people responding to the picture not unadjusted box office media spin The genius of THE GREAT CARUSO was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of Enrico Caruso really not a great story anyway and threw it in the trash Instead 90 of the movies focus was on the music Thus MGM gave us the best living opera singer MARIO LANZA doing the music of the bestever historic opera singer ENRICO CARUSO The result was a wonderful movie Too bad LANZA would throw his life and career away on overeating Too fat to play THE STUDENT PRINCE Edmund Purdom took his place with Lanzas voice dubbed in and with the formerly handsome and notfat Lanza pictured in the advertising If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO its almost always on eBay for 200 or less Dont be put off by the low price as it reflects only the easy availability of copies not the quality of the movie
0	Over the years Ive seen a bunch of these straight to video Segal movies and every one holds the same amount of entertainment unfortanetley the entertainment level is at a low Sure the action sequences were amusing but that was pretty much it Seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like Under Siege Under Siege 2 and Executive Decisionat least on the action standpoint but during the past ten years these types of movies that star Segal really do not meet his past qualificationsbr br On the more positive side the movie did make good use of time like some of the action sequences and use of wit Just when the movie seemed to just drag on a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter I honestly believe that more of Segals movies would do better if he wasnt the only one that fans recognize in the movie Supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses maybe the movie will get more popular results
1	Of course you could never go into a theatre and witness the types of sets you get in this film From that point of view it is utter fantasy But who cares It is certainly true that you will not find this film listed in with Citizen Kane Battleship Potyomkin and all the other films the pseuds tell us we should be watching Films like this are worth a hundred Citizen KanesIt is about what cinema does best great camerawork great settings and great performancesbr br The three spectacular scenes at the end are probably best in the order they are presented keeping the best till lastbr br I will gladly watch this film again and again and again and
1	On Sunday July 27 1997 the first episode of a new science fiction series called Stargate SG1 was broadcast on Showtime A spinoff of and sequel to the 1994 film Stargate starring Kurt Russell and James Spader the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film For ten seasons it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as SG1 Originally the series starred Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack ONeill two ls Michael Shanks as Dr Daniel Jackson Amanda Tapping as Captain Samantha Carter Christopher Judge as Tealc and Don S Davis as Major General George S Hammond For ten long years we watched the team battle against the Goauld the Replicators the Ori and many other aggressors At the same time they forged alliances with the Asgard the Tokra the rebel Jaffa the Nox and the Tollan They saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up not until death claimed them And sometimes not even thenbr br As with all longrunning series they were numerous cast changes Michael Shanks left the series in January 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor Daniel Jacksons successor as the teams resident archaeologistgeek was Jonas Quinn an alien from a country called Kelowna on the planet Langara played by Corin Nemec However Shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in June 2003 and Nemec left at the same time Unfortunately he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards Don S Davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in March 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go The shows original star and arguably its most popular actor Richard Dean Anderson starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons His participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons He finally left SG1 in March 2005 in order to spend more time with his then sixyearold daughter Jack ONeill was by far my favourite character in the series and truth be told I never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as I did the earlier episodes for that very reasonbr br The ninth season represented a new era for the programme With the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the Goauld and the Replicators in Season Eight many fans felt the series should go out on a high Regardless the series carried on for a further two years with the Ori replacing the Goauld as the series main adversaries Three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this reinvention Ben Browder came in as the cocky Southern Air Force pilot Lt Colonel Cameron Mitchell the new leader of SG1 His Farscape costar the lovely Claudia Black began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious sexy hilarious and certainly extroverted Vala Mal Doran a former Goauld host and con artist from another planet A recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season Rounding off the cast was the legendary Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry the new commander of the SGC and an old friend of Jack ONeill and General Hammond For the last two years they starred alongside the SG1 faithful Michael Shanks Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the Stargate franchisebr br Alas all good things must come to an end During the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of Season Ten ratings dropped considerably resulting in cancellation in its August 2006 After ten seasons and 214 episodes the dream was finally over On March 13 2007 what began with Children of the Gods ended with Unending The series finale made its world premiere on Sky One in Britain and Ireland before being shown on the SciFi Channel in the United States on June 22 2007br br In the ten years that the series was on the air it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series Star Trek in terms of popularity in certain countries It became the secondlongest running scifi series in the world second only to Doctor Who 19631989 and the longestrunning American produced scifi series having surpassed The XFiles only a few months before it endedbr br Stargate SG1 represents the cornerstone of the Stargate franchise In 2004 its success and popularity led to the production of a spinoff series entitled Stargate Atlantis which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in August 2008 Although plans for another feature film fell through two directtoDVD films Stargate The Ark of Truth and Stargate Continuum were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future A third liveaction series Stargate Universe is also due to premiere at some point next year There was unfortunately an animated series Stargate Infinity which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better Despite the end of SG1 and Atlantis as continuing series the future of Stargate looks very bright indeedbr br In conclusion while Stargate has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major scifi television franchises such as Star Trek and Doctor Who its still relatively new compared to those two scifi giants and I have every confidence that it will continue for many many years to come
1	Given the opposite circumstance of 2009 where the reality is we do have a black president this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance For entertainment value I found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant I was quite taken back of course by the blatant racism of the time but also found the music and dancing incredible Also it is quite cool to see Sammy Davis Jr as such a very young child actor He plays Rufus Jones a young boy who is being consoled by his Mammy He is told Why some day you could be President This was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was mocked and thought to be endearing charming and funny The bulk of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be like if it was run by a black man They depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist Baptist churchbr br The fact was when I stumbled onto this movie one day it drew me in It is really well done and very entertaining I believe if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movie for all it brings us In fact to realize that it is not only not ridiculous to have a black president but that it is normal just makes this movie that much more relevant It clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness
0	Its a hideous little production apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches Its an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stopmotion animation Its weird but its not the kind of fun weird trip anyone optimistic might expect Its the cold inhuman unfriendly sickening even creepy kind of weird There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie After all Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material And CosgroveHall did far more attractive things with stopmotionbr br Interestingly this is a French production As such it reenforces the stereotype that the French have no concept of scary
0	Not since Caligula have I considered turning off the movie halfway throughbut then with this one I was only 15 minutes in when I considered Unfortunately I did make it all the way through Make sure that you do notbr br Its not that Cradle of Fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual Its that its not any of those things yet it so desperately wants to be all of them Instead its boring trite ordinary predictable and unexceptionally poorly executed shot on video high school special effects no sense of even basic visual storytelling dialog barely audiblenot that its worth hearing thoughbr br This movie is proof for the argument that even the straighttovideo distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere
0	It was everything this isnt it had pace pop and actors who werent afraid to chew the scenery It also had a decent script This one had me scratching my head If Farrah isnt really serious about a career why does she have a manager and why is he wasting his time If Kate and Barney are artists why do they sign up for The Mother of All Jiggle Shows like the Brady Bunch movie where Robert Reed wants to do Shakespeare only to find himself on BB They werent industry names but they werent exactly starving either And while they got the history right the poster was released before Farrah got the show Silverman rejecting pitches for Funniest Home Videos and American Idol and Spelling promising his baby girl Tori someday hell create a show for her obviously did not happenbr br What bothered me was how Spellings role is distorted Hes shown as the showrunner and creator when he was neither And how he comes up with the idea for CA was is laughablebr br How were Spelling and Goldberg allowed to enforce Farrahs oral contract when the others were signed And why didnt Farrah or Bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her Inner Diva but because Majors wanted her to This is why when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting Farrah up as the bad girl like Suzanne Somers it fails because the groundwork was never laid that was where the Threes Company pic delivered

0	This is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen the poor special effects along with the poor acting are just a few of the things wrong with this film I am fan of the first two major leagues but this one is lame
0	This TV movie goes to show that bad films do exist The only reason I saw this was it was covered on a KTMA MST3K Its Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans However no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing With the many stars in this film it made no difference I really dont know why I watched this
0	The only thing that The First Power really has going for it is that it affords Jeff Kober an opportunity to play one of his lovely variety of psychotic villains that hes done so well in the last 25 years Kober is a worthy successor to Lyle Bettger who specialized in those parts back in the Fiftiesbr br But its not enough The First Power is a souped up slasher flick that has Lou Diamond Phillips wasted as an LAPD detective who has a specialty in catching serial killers Kober is his latest catch but Kobers in league with a lower power and theyre going to team up and make Lous life miserable for him Even after Kober is given the gas chamber his spirit comes back in all kinds of guisesbr br Mykelti Williamson is on hand as Lous partner who meets a nasty end involving a demon possessed horse and Tracy Griffith as a psychic and Elizabeth Arlen as a nun with insights are around to help Lou Will he succeed in battling forces from beyondbr br By the time the film ends you no longer care Lou really got trapped in a turkey Maybe the devil made him do this film
0	I am a big 1930s movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies thats new for me So I gave this a shot after all its the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian I have watched much less of Lloyds silent films then of Chaplins but I have to say Im a much bigger Chaplin fan Anyway this film fell so flat for me that I didnt finish it I can understand why his sound career was so limited he didnt get very good material to work with After youve seen Chaplin Abbott and Costello The Three Stooges Martin and Lewis The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs or violence in general this one is very forgettable I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory but his role here also did nothing special for me Maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film at least it seemed that way is before he gets in a ring I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time 4 out of 10 Dont watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again very flat For an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general I recommend Kelly The Second made a few years earlier another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel
1	Before Sunrise is a wonderful love story and has to be among my Top 5 favorite movies ever Dialog and acting are great I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts Of course the romantic Vienna introduced in the movie does not exist you wont find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night and it isnt possible to get to all the places in only one night either especially if youre a stranger and its your first night in Vienna But thats not the point The relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic Although nothing ever really happens the movie never gets boring The ending is genuinely sad without being Titanic or something Even if you dont like love stories you should watch this film Im a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer The first part is perfect as it is in my opinion
0	What can I say about this film other than dont see it I waited and waited and WAITED for someting or anything to happen and it just didnt come Watch amazingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie What are they doing Are they solving a mystery Are they gathering clues Possibly its just hard to tell At the end of the movie after a lot of radio signals are decoded illegibly on some sort of PET monitor and this guy gives some lectures the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible Some aliens want to get back to their home world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth I guess they dont like sharing the wealth My guess is they finished filming and saw their 35 minute work or art garbage and decided that theyd let the editing crew turn it into an 88 minute feature film Watch at your own peril its not even funny because its so bad its just bad
0	Comparison with American Graffiti is inevitable so save your money and time by renting that timeless classic Speaking of timeliness there was an episode of Cheers where Norm and Cliff competed on who can find the most anachronism in a movie They would have loved this movie everything from some of the songs and some of the clothing were wrong There were sly reference such as they paved paradise to put up a parking lot The filmmakers hoped to elicit some smiles from us but basically made me groanbr br The characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially astute for teenagers Almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and forties when they wrote the darn movie Very little of what the characters said were believable Combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just totally fail Although there were two exceptions Kelli Williams liven things up as the future flower child and despite what another reviewer said Rick Shroeder was quite good Showing that brooding characteristic that would come to full boil in his eventual appearance in NYPD Blues
1	Religious bigotry is rampant everywhere Australia is not immune to itbr br A dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having killed her own baby I dont mean to spoil the story for you but you need to know the basics before getting kneedeep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prisonbr br Buy or rent the movie and discover how deepseated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the globebr br This is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actorsbr br Both Meryl Streep with her famous Aussie accent and Sam Neill whose accent is his nativeborn pronunciation are outstanding Those with supporting roles are also quite goodbr br You will remember this movie for many yearsbr br See it
0	This movie was like a bad indie with Alist talent The plot was silly all the way to the end It reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the 1980s I would have given it a one but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile I think the worst thing was the underwater scenes held off of the dock The underwater lighting seemed to come from no were and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air this air tank would kind of appear I would avoid this unless there is nothing else on the shelf Good Day

1	It has said that The Movies and Baseball both thrived during The Great Depression It appears that the grim realities of a Nation caught up in the aftermath of this Economic Disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace A temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is Baseballbr br Likewise an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours into the darkened auditoriums of the Cinema The presence of a Radio in just about everyones house hold kept Depression Era America at once attuned to Worlds Events and provided many a Drama and especially Comedy Shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh realitybr br The literature of the time also flourished at all levels The juvenile reading habits helped to create the Comic Book as we know it what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures But the Comic Book just did not magically appear all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages all by itself There were mediums that were ancestral to them Obviouslythe Newspaper Comic Strip was one parent providing the visualnarrative method of story tellingbr br The other direct ancestor was the Pulp Magazine The inexpensive prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going though not necessarily serialized tales The pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to Edgar Rice Borroughs TARZAN and Johnston McCulleys ZORRO The 1930s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like THE SHADOW THE AVENGER G8s BATTLE ACES and THE SPIDERMASTER of MEN all found their way to the news stands among many othersbr br One other was DOC SAVAGE a fullblooded super hero of the written story the covers of the pulps had perhaps the only picture of the hero Possessing extraordinary strength super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect Doc was the prototype Super Herobr br He also assembled 5 of his former Army Buddies into a small free lancing team of adventurers Each of them was an expert in a given field So we had a top rated Chemist Lawyer Construction Engineer Electrical Engineer GeologistArchaeologistPaleontologist etcbr br The Doc Savage stories were very popular in the 1930s and 40s and were published into the middle 50s Then they went into a hiatus for a good 1215 years Then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new container the paperback book A fresh look to the cover art was introduced featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular Doc with a perpetually ripped shirtbr br The reintroduction proved to be highly successful with the publication of a title a month and for a while more Soon there was a rumor of a Doc Savage movie But when by what Producer Well the venerable Man of Bronze was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together It was veteran Stopaction Animator and Producer of top Special Effects films Geoprge Pal who did the film along with Warner Brothersbr br When DOC SAVAGE MAN OF BRONZE arrived in the Movie Houses it boasted of a well casted team of actors albeit a largely No Name as far familiarity with the viewers With former Tarzan of TVRon Elys nearly perfect casting in the lead up and coming Beauty of a Starlette Pamela Hensley in the female lead and veteran character Paul Wexler as the villainous Captain Seas no other name would have been recognized And just maybe that was a plus in this casebr br The story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going Use of narration by Paul Frees and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the storybr br From the very start there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured Camp humor as the Batman TV series Some really great looking early scenes involving Doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the Paul Frees narration and the unexpected unlikely outcomes For Example an experiment of Docs with a miniature rocketmissile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish a small one at that The whole story unfolds like that hitting the viewer with a little Camp every so often as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously We are also puzzled about Mr George Pals being the Producerhis last He who had been so well known for Special Effects surely a factor that could be put to good use in a scifi action setting of the Pulp Characters worldbr br I can remember seeing it quite vividly Mrs Ryan Deanna was in the Hospital just having given birth to our 2nd child Michelle081475 Our older girl Jennifer was visiting her Grandmother so after visiting hours were over in the Maternity Ward it was straight over to the old Marquette Theatre 63rd Kedzie here in Chicagobr br Having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with Doc I was sort of let down by the final product I could accept a little of this Camp business but would not have objected if MrPal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat Dinosaurs and Volcanoes to give it all a little more PulpComicSerial type excitementbr br And yet the cast headedup by Mr Ely and the others made the whole film likable if not lovable The sets and locations were as far as we can see very much like those of a 30s serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyonebr br And maybe thats just what they were trying for with this DOC SAVAGE MAN of BRONZE
1	Seldom do we see such short comments written by IMDb filmgoers Perhaps its because this lightweight dark comedy entertains and pleases without depth or are we missing something Id watch it again if I had some incentivebr br So whats a happenstance To the French it is Le Battement dAiles du Papillon Serendipity Fate Perhaps its an event that is the culmination of a series of random happenings Weve all had these its called life but when looked at in this way you begin to get the feeling that random might be more like fatedbr br A happenstance in this film might be an occurrence as minor as knocking a few leaves of lettuce off the back of a truck or as major as basing a major life decision on the accuracy of a stranger tossing of a pebble All these incidents cause other events that well you get the picture Dominoes Multiply those by 30 characters and an average of 6 each and you have to really stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario could happen And I think that theres a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like this But then this is the magic world of cinemabr br We admit that it is fun to watch the way the writerdirector weaves together these unrelated events into a story which enmeshes the lives of these French citizens If you have a couple of hours and are looking for a whimsical escape heres the place to do it Or if youre recovering from surgery and arent going anywhere anyway this will engage you while your stitches are healing br br Happenstance will not go down as an award winner but it should develop a cult following Stranger things have happenedbr br Soren Kierkegaard is attributed with the following Life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forward If you looked at the detail in many of your own life experiences meeting your first love finding the perfect gift your last auto accident you would find a series of seemingly random events leading up to itbr br Thats the answer I forgot to bring along an existentialist to explain Happenstance to me
1	I have to say I totally loved the movie It had its funny moments some heartwarming parts just all around good Me personally really liked the movie because its something that finally i can relate to my childhood This movie in my opinion is geared more towards the young gay population It shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up All the taunting namecalling and not knowing is something I like most other young feminine boys will always remember and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay So I would definitely recommend seeing this movie Probably shouldnt really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it
1	I rented this movie this past weekend cranked up the surround sound system and got some great sound from special affects This movie is a great movie rental the special affects where enough to scare my fiance but I noticed some looked suprisingly computer generated I didnt go to the movies and see this but its a scary late night dont feel like going out movie I would recommend it
1	I have to say that the events of 911 didnt hit me until I saw this documentary It took me a year to come to grips with the devastation I was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on TV if there was any talk about the towers I was sick of hearing about it When this was aired on TV a year and a day later I was bawling my eyes out It was the first time I had cried since the attack I highly recommend this documentary I am watching it now on TV 5 years later and I am still crying over the tragedies The fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing It was an accident and look where it got them These two brothers make me want to have been there to help
1	A classic cartoon always enjoyable and funny It has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters Road Rovers is a show worth seeing it is a short 13 episodes and if you can ever manage a chance to see it you should Unfortunately it is very hard to find I think Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD that contains all 13 episodes I would definitely buy it if they did and if they do you should buy it too if you have kids who like dogs they will love road rovers Road Rovers should have gotten more attention while it was being aired it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was
0	I agree with the previous comment the beginning of the movie is quite good and gets you wandering about what is to come Which is nothing All open story lines remain open two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture save for 1 or 2 very short scenes I wander if Ilya wouldnt have done better to just completely leave them out As for the one remaining character nothing is done with her either She just visits some godawful place and suddenly the movie isnt about her anymore but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread drinking homemade vodka and apparently flashing each other Some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling like the judges of the IFFR but for me it is just bad taste bad camerawork a lousy script and frightfully bad direction Therefor I can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading 1

0	I think the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy I know I wouldnt have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a crocbr br But everything in this movie is bad Farting jokes people getting eaten and the skit about the President all make the movie one of the worst of all timebr br Its a really bad film that you have to stay away from All the jokes are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid The plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years oldbr br Im surprised the Croc Hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this
1	This film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments I loved the character of Matt and also Tiny They seemed the most engaging and funny characters and certainly the most interesting Matt is very good as is his no good cousin and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy I must say I saw striking similarities between Matt and another Aussie actor Eric Bana My personal favourite part was the brothel scene loved that Overall I liked the film and itll get about an 8 rating The penalty however I was disappointed in It was a side foot curl rather than the appropriate laces blastbr br I am of course kidding
1	I have always been keen on watching Hong Kong movies but all of them failed to meet my expectationsuntil now BURNING PARADISE doesnt contain the flat humor most HK movies have nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film The story is not complex but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some intelligent space the only truely intelligent martial arts film I have seen is CROUCHING TIGER but since Hollywood is involved it is no true HK movie for me There are some incredible fight scenes in this movie from the first onewhich is one of the coolest I have ever seen yet so short to the last main scenes But mind theres also a lot of blood that flows people cut in half decapitated etc The production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical notice the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall Yep its not Tsui Hark or John Woo that made my favorite Hong Kong film its Ringo Lam And Im sure as hell going to check out more from this director Ace
0	Rural family dramawith perhaps a nod to Ordinary Peopleconcerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap Despite downbeat subject matter given mercilessly glum treatment by director Christopher Cain there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring Unfortunately the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience What with Robert Duvall Glenn Close and Wilford Brimley in the cast the movie is nearly a smallscaled reunion of The Natural Too bad this project didnt get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping memorable picture 12 from
1	This is a VERY entertaining movie A few of the reviews that I have read on this forum have been written by people who apparently think that the film was an effort at serious drama IT WAS NOT MADE THAT WAYIt is an extremely enjoyable film performed in a tongue in cheek manner All of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us The fight sequences are lively brisk and above all not gratuitous The socalled Green Death utilized on a couple of occasions is not as I read in one review gruesome A couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between Doc and Seas near the end of the film Hey lighten up Again I remind one and all that this is a fun film Each phase of this fight was captioned which added to the fun aspect The actors were not trying to emulate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan This is NOT one of those martial arts films Ron Ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play Doc Another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the bad guy Seas is dealt with I promise you that if you dont try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value you will spend 100 minutes in a most enjoyable manner
0	This was a blind buy used DVD It totally killed a nice buzz I had going when I hit playbr br Its bubbleheaded comedy but its um squalid The plot is ZANY but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived I ultimately found it depressing to watchbr br Maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven goofy caper film I know I know the quotes on the box the Academy Award nomination mean nothing
0	This film is really bad with a script full of memorable lines and incredibly bad performances The special effects are also bad not the worst ones I have seen either and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it Just two short themes 30 seconds long or so are repeated constantly throughout the whole filmbr br All in all one of the worst films I have ever seen
0	The movie starts quite with an intriguing scene three people are drinking and making small talk in a bar All of them are making up a bit outrageous stories As the movie unfolds it turns out that the most outrageous story is true However beyond that the movie is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where main secret is revealed This revelation happens barely half time into the movie and frankly not much is left to be seen The rest of the time director is lingering in a god forsaken Russian village full of pitiful and creepy old ladies Sure these are fascinating and a bit shocking images but admiring them goes on way too long sacrificing any possible plot or character development I found this movie as another example of either lousy or lazy moviemaking where instead of trying to make an interesting story movie makers concentrate on weirdly fascinating imagery and through in a few almost unrelated stories case in point meat traders story to leave the spectator to figure out all odds and ends On a surface it has artsy appearance but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent
1	what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slaps and the kicks how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know im sure they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder if it was however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done and is probibly the only thing on film that has ever shocked me
1	YETI deserves the 8 star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made I saw it at a midnight screening in LA and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity this movie is one of those cinematic trainwrecks where you think it cant get any stranger and THEN IT DOES The millionaire who funds the project to thaw the Yeti looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman both poured into an illfitting suit the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen and yes there is a mute boy who sorta kinda looks like a girl and hes mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents hmmm maybe therapy for the kid Then this hottie Italian girl is seen by Yeti once he thaws which takes FOREVER and he is instantly in love with her what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant Yeti makes bedroom eyes at her its like a large Barry White trying to seduce a groupie In fact once the large Yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest she accidentally touches the Yetis nipple and yes the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple GET HARD Yikes of all YIKES Plus theres a collie dog in it because the Italian producer must have heard that American audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a Lassie theres also this insane scene where the Yeti eats a giant fish keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the Italian girls hair Gee thanks Yeti now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout Youre the best This film is more bizarre than something Ed Wood could have ever dreamt up If you are a fan of classic cinema crap seek this baby out
0	STRANGER THAN FICTION angered me so much I signed up on IMDb just to write this review STRANGER THAN FICTION is a surprisingly complex touching and thoughtprovoking movie until the very end Once you suspend multiple lapses of logic why didnt Will Ferrell hear Emma Thompsons voice 10 years ago when she fist started writing her book The phone rang The phone rang again How could she not know its him calling etc the movie challenges ones thoughts about mortality fate and sacrificebr br The brief history of literary themes provided by Dustin Hoffman should especially entertain former English majors And Maggie Gyllenhaal is always a pleasure even though Will Ferrell might just as easily be an ax murderer as a bumbling soul Her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faithbr br Ah but the ending Until the very end I would have given 9 out of 10 stars to this movie The movie as a metaphor for lifes journey as a tribute to the notion of writing true as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy but not both is outstanding The entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of Will Ferrells fate And no matter how endearing a character he may have become we know full well why we will accept the ending The last act occurs the screen goes white the credits roll A profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film An end that would have been debated for weeksbr br NO No credits rolled Say it isnt so Say Hollywood didnt tack on another 10 minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie Dustin Hoffman got it right when he said Its no longer a masterpiece its OK An apt review of the movie Except to me it wasnt even OK I was so offended about the betrayal of writing true about the decision to pander the film that I actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie I dont often cry I could care less about most movies but I am still angry about this onebr br My questions for Zack Helm the writer are this did the original movie end when the screen went white And were you forced by the vapid movie powersthatbe to tack on an ending unfaithful to the core of the movie Or did you tack that maudlin ending on yourself Ive read youre brilliant I hope your original script ended the movie the first timebr br I know Zack Helm will never see this review and Ive been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself But please moviegoers am I the only one who feels this way about STRANGER THAN FICTION One good thing came from me seeing this movie I doubly admire LOST IN TRANSLATION now
0	Ive seen a lot of movies and rarely would I ever rate a movie 1 but this movie was beyond terriblebr br The acting was terrible the plot was ridiculous the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying Usually when I watch scary movies I think its DUMB when the characters hears a noise in houseforestschooletc and then yells out hello is anyone there but at least theyre believable when they do it This movie couldnt even get that rightbr br This is a movie thatll make other Bhorror movies like Venom and The Fog look like academy award winning masterpiecesbr br I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and I write this comment so that anyone else whos thinking of watching this movie will think again ITS AWFUL
1	I had some reservations about this movie I figured it would be the usual bill of fare a formula movie about Christmas Being in the middle of a heat wave in late June we decided to give it a shot anyway maybe we would see some snowbr br This movie turned out to be one laugh after another Ben Affleck was believable in his character but the real star of this one is James Gandofini He delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great dadbr br If you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours definitely check this one out
1	Just watched the film for the 3rd time and enjoyed Lindsay Crouse and the rest of the cast just as much as before It just keeps getting better and better You simply have to marvel at the carefully measured way of speech the slow deliberate action everything being exactly in placebr br Truly one of the great ones and definitely my alltime favourite
1	Sweet and charming funny and poignant plot less but meaningful Before Sunrise 1995 the third movie of Richard Linklater is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love is in love or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it It is one of the very rare movies that isshouldwill be equally interesting to teenagers their parents and even grandparents It seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects car chases or long and steamy sex scenes Two young people in their early 20s two college students American tourist Ethan Hawke who is returning home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend the classes in Sorbonne meet on a train They are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking they hop off the train in Vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night They talk and fall in love Thats it thats the movie It couldve been boring and silly but instead it is a lovely believable clever and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing at least for this viewer High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters superb writing always interesting and witty dialogs two awesome performances and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is Julie Delpy who looks like a Botticellis angel is great in portraying smart independent and incredibly attractive young woman
0	Seriously crappy moviebr br First off the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehousefurniture store The bad cop takes a girl which they had pulled over into the warehouses attic while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there The bad cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag and the newbie cop doesnt think there are any problems but he still wonders what was in the bag so he asks gets a bullshit response and then he thinks everything is OK for nowbr br The bad cop repeats this process and even once with a tit scene made it slightly better But eventually people start to catch on which took awhile considering how fing obvious it was One girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies like ya do Now the bad cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch and then he gets rid of the duffelbagged bodybr br Since she had the oogeyboogey magic put on her she comes back with lots of eyeshadow on which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie also the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become eyeshadow monsters Some of the girls meet up with a dude who is apparently a currency specialist and he offers them a ride they look normal to him apparently But when the girls see other people such as the one girls husband he freaks out because she is hideous some people freak out but others dont even notice massive plot holebr br So to wrap it up the eyeshadow monsters kill the bad cop who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene It was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel Like anyone would want to see part 2 of this cow dropping
1	The Great Caruso displays the unique talents of Mario Lanza He shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer paired with Dorothy Kirsten soprano of the Metropolitan Opera Indeed I dare to say that he performs some songs better than Caruso check AVuchella from Tosti and La Danza from Rossini The MGM art and music departments also did a good job This movie could be perfect were it not for the awkward presence of Ann Blyth we see that she is trying her best dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before 1920 unforgivable Lanza deserved a better leading lady and Blyth should stick to less demanding productions Also notice that Ms Kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with Lanza giving the wrong notion that Caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano
1	This series was a cut above the rest of the TV detective series of the day but somehow didnt find an audiencebr br The idea of a blind detective may not be totally new but added so much to the story And who could forget Pax the beautiful guide dog in the seriesbr br Whilst the stories themselves may have been no better than the average series the settings in New Orleans the acting and the music I note the comment about the music score in other comments I remember that clearly all work to make a good television series even betterbr br Well you never know one day Paramount might just dig into its archives and release it on DVD

0	I really didnt like this movie because it didnt really bring across the messages and ideas LEngle brought out in her novel We had read the novel in our English class and i absolutely loved it im afraid i cant say the same for the film There were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didnt do any credit to the imaginative genius that is Madeleine LEngle This is the reason i gave it such a poor rating Dont see this movie if you are a big fan of LEngles texts because you will be sorely disappointed However if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes or educational as was my case then it is an alright movie
0	I have absolutely no knowledge of author Phillipa Pearce or any of her novels and if TOMS MIDNIGHT GARDEN is typical of her work I probably would have had little interest in her books as a child When I was a child I wasnt really interested in litreture unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count br br Judging by this film version of TOMS MIDNIGHT GARDEN I guess Pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist Tom Long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a metaphysical one Having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people didnt have in the 1950s so I guess theres some political class ridden subtext there somewhere Theres also a romance involving a young girl called Hattie but again are cynical kids amoured by love stories Perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative br br This is a childrens film that seems dated by its source Its inoffensive but Im surprised by its high rating by the IMDB voters I wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were 10 year olds whod just seen the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy

1	When I found the movie in the schedule for Christmas its title did not sound familiar to me since I have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film Yet having read the content I decided to spend my Christmas evening on watching the movie The effect surprised me totally I do not remember when I last saw a film in which every single moment involved me A VOW TO CHERISH is without any doubt one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise I have received from cinema Here are some arguments of mine why I consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema br br First the entire content is particularly educational It has something to offer to the modern audience pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions Is there a need for Christ in our times Does Love still matter What for is there faith What is the logics of burden and suffering in life Is there really Someone by my side I can always trust The movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of usbr br Second the movie is exceptionally humane The main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions Is it better for Kyle David Denman and Teri Megan Paul to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home Is it better for John Ken Howard to leave Ellen Barbara Babcock his sick wife and start a new happy life with Julia Donna Bullock a woman he falls in love with In fact Ellen no longer recognizes him Yet he decides to vow HIS WIFE eternal fidelity Had Johns rebellious brother Phil D David Morin better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life Phils prayer to God in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity These words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where when or how they livebr br Third the movie is a great portrayal of family not very popular nowadays there are problems yet there is always something more powerful that gets these people together This something is love and trust I know that it may seem a bit idealistic Not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that Nevertheless it is a very educational aspect and a realistic onebr br Fourth the entire film focuses on peoples mutual help If we want to live happy lives in our society we must understand one thing we have to help one another Alexander Ossie Davis is an example of such attitude At the beginning of the movie we see him talk to John about praying Later he helps his brother Alexander is a kinda angel that is sent to John and his family Isnt it possible that we may become angels to one anotherbr br Fifth the artistic features are also worth attention PERFORMANCES Barbara Babcock gives an authentic performance as Ellen and although she has a difficult role she does a perfect job Consider for instance the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again Ken Howard is also memorable as the faithful husband PICTURE The most memorable for me was the scene of John and Ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves autumn while the sunshine love spreads everywhere I interpreted as a sort of symbol even if there is sorrow this can always be illuminated by light and joybr br A VOW TO CHERISH is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe At the end I would like to quote the profound words from the movie I found very touching and hope you will also do br br Kyle to his uncle Phil Yes he John Brighton lives according to the Bible But nobody forces you to do so Yet according to what rules do you live
0	LL Cool J Morgan Freeman Dylan McDermott Kevin Spacey John Heard Cary Elwes Roslyn Sanchez Justin Timberlake wait a minute Justin Timberlake And hes the star I should have known better than to rent EDISON FORCE In fact I did know better But in a moment of absolute weakness I rented this STV When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in an STV you know its one of two things an indie or a dog As in satonashelf Which this did And with good reason The plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la MAGNUM FORCE and journalist Timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them He is targeted for his efforts or maybe I should say for his horrible acting I turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing Just awful The real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see Freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard looking like nothing so much as a hobo You just know the director was not in control Freeman is clearly slumming
1	You know how Star Trek fans flocked to all the Star Trek movies even the really bad ones Why To see their heroes in action one more time Thats the way I feel about Doc Savage I am a major fanatic for the character and the prospect of seeing Doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming And the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation Then they decided to crib elements from a number of Doc adventures and throw them into this one movie resulting in a somewhat disjointed film Theres a lot of promise in here diluted by a number of unfortunate choices the music the camp elements etc But the spirit of Doc is there and thats what those of us familiar with Doc and his crew respond to So in my longwinded way what Im trying to say is that this is not a bad movie its just not as good as it should have been And anyone who is a fan of Superman James Bond Indiana Jones Buckaroo Banzai and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all
0	Honestly before I watched this movie I had heard many people said this movie was a disgrace I did not believe that since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey have taken roles in this movie and watched it by my own Apparently they were right I was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie why the hell did I watch this moviebr br Of course I was not expecting much from Justin as he really does not belong in the movietheater business But Morgan and Kevin I could not stop asking myself why the heck they agreed to take part in Edison To be honest their roles are rather stupidbr br Well you might think if the players suck then I should pay more attention to the story It is indeed story is the core of a movie but guys trust me this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its story Imagine this a smartass journalist Justin Timberlake wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a real journalist from his boss Morgan Freeman This all was supported by one agent who still has heart for justice LL Cool J and an brilliant investigator Kevin Spacey At the end they beat the system with a happy ending storybr br Jeez I could not even carry on with this Just recalling the movie is making me sick already My advise guys dont watch this Please save your money and time for another movie
1	House Of Games is definitely not without its flaws plot holes stiff acting final scenes but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head House Of Games does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do Of course this is not a huge feat given the fact that were dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate So it stands to reason that we never really know whats going on even though we think that we do But thats what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessitiesbr br It has a definite Hitchcock slant to it The film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort Marnie considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the Masters more thoughtprovoking works One could easily consider the idea of Lindsay Crouses character being the same as Tippi Hedrinsten year later perhaps Both are strongwilled loners both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool As Crouses repressed uptight character says Whats life without adventure Put your Reality Check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks
0	Murder By Numbers is one of those movies that you expect is madeforTV but isnt Considering the only actor of any note is Bullock although Michael Pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things it isnt a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things Like remembering to lock your front door when you go out Or putting clothes back on when you come out of the showerbr br Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather a cop with personal issues dont they all Together with her new partner a wetlooking Ben Chaplin she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman Nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think theyve planned and executed the perfect murder As the investigation continues a battle of wills emerges between Cassie and the main suspect Richie Haywood Ryan Goslingbr br The crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless Bullock though she is very nice to look at is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as Rodney Dangerfield actually hed be better Chaplin for his sins is a complete nonentity and I feel sorry that he has to put this film on his CV in his attempt to break into Hollywood At least Gosling and Pitt as the conniving sneering suspects acquit themselves adequately As if dodgy leads werent bad enough a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable but illogical ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to runbr br Murder By Numbers has absolutely nothing going for it even a pointless nude scene by Bullock wouldnt redeem it Well just a little but still not enough to save it Forgettable predictable and redundant this is one film that isnt going to move the cop genre forward As Cassie probably says on her next case theres nothing to see here people Move along keep moving
1	If you want a serious laugh pain watch this movie and the things Bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster The deleted scenes are priceless I dont know why they didnt include them in the original movie It cant be because of time since the movie is only 101 minutes long Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor who has been overlooked for too long Jim Carrey needs meds

0	Raising Victor Vargas A Reviewbr br You know Raising Victor Vargas is like sticking your hands into a big steaming bowl of oatmeal Its warm and gooey but youre not sure if it feels right Try as I might no matter how warm and gooey Raising Victor Vargas became I was always aware that something didnt quite feel right Victor Vargas suffers from a certain overconfidence on the directors part Apparently the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a Latino family on the lower east side and an idyllic storyline would make the film critic proof He was right but it didnt fool me Raising Victor Vargas is the story about a seventeenyear old boy called you guessed it Victor Vargas Victor Rasuk who lives his teenage years chasing more skirt than the Rolling Stones could do in all the years theyve toured The movie starts off in Ugly Fat Donnas bedroom where Victor is sure to seduce her but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his bestfriend Harold Kevin Rivera comesalooking for him Caught in the attempt by Harold and his sister Victor Vargas runs off for damage control Yet even with the embarrassing implication that hes been boffing the homeliest girl in the neighborhood nothing dissuades young Victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat On a hot New York City day they make way to the local public swimming pool where Victors eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young nymph Judy Judy Marte whos not just pretty but a strong and independent too The relationship that develops between Victor and Judy becomes the focus of the film The story also focuses on Victors family that is comprised of his grandmother or abuelita Altagracia Guzman his brother Nino also played by real life brother to Victor Silvestre Rasuk and his sister Vicky Krystal Rodriguez The action follows Victor between scenes with Judy and scenes with his family Victor tries to cope with being an oversexed pimpdaddy his feelings for Judy and his grandmothers conservative Catholic upbringingbr br The problems that arise from Raising Victor Vargas are a few but glaring errors Throughout the film you get to know certain characters like Vicky Nino Grandma Judy and even Judys best friend Melonie The problem is we know nothing of Victor Vargas except that he is the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood We know that he knows how to lick his lips and comb his fro and carry himself for the sake of wooing girls into the sack but thats all We know that Nino plays piano and quiet well you could see it by the awards on the family piano We know his sister Nicki is a gossiploving girl with an invested interest in watching TV We know that grandma is a hardworking traditional Latina woman whos trying to raise her kids with conservatively in a world of excess corruption Yet where is the titular character Victor Vargas Hes in this movie somewhere but we only know what the movie tells us This is by far the films biggest flaw Victor Vargas isnt so much a character but a pingpong ball bouncing between scenes with Judy and his Grandmother but we never get to know who Victor Vargas really is This is important because as Ive mentioned the only thing we know of Victor Vargas is that hes a sexually active teenager with a libido the size of Manhattan Hes a total Alphamale Victor Vargas is not the kind of character I sympathize with at all Why should anyone So by the end of the movie in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow Victor Vargas has attained ANY depth and learned the errors of his ways How could such a twodimensional character have any depth If only the director had worried a little more about fleshing out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect handheld shotbr br Raising Victor Vargas brings to life the world of the Latino innercity neighborhood to the big screen Something that few films have done before in the past The film has been complimented for feeling so real and I wontbr br argue with that I havent seen this level of reality since CBS aired Survivor Seriously although the movie has some nice shots of the city the writerdirector Peter Sollett was way too dependent on closeups and handheld shots This problem is particularly noticed in indoor scenes that are so claustrophobic I was forced to perform deepbreathing exercises to keep from passing out As the film continues the shots get tighter and tighter with faces cropped from brow to chin on the screen you can practically smell Victor Vargass cheap cologne The overall effect is unrealistic in contrast The indoor scenes of innercity apartments make them look small and cramp which is not true Ive been in those type apartments I used to live in one Theyre not splendorous but they have high ceilings and theyre decent living spaces By the movies standards youd think that these apartments were 5x5 cells of brickandmortar chipped paint and cracked walls Unfortunately Solletts constant use of closeups and one particularly bad shot with a zoomin on one scene come off as totally amateurish But Raising Victor Vargas is only Solletts second film and his most well known a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films One review I read summarized the movie as Ethnicity for Ethnicitys Sake and I cannot agree more If Victor Vargas were truly a great film and story then the characters applicability wouldnt matter whether they were Latino Chinese etc Yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middleclass suburbia with a bunch of teenybopper white kids the results wouldnt be such glowing reviews and wed see the films flaws more clearly Indeed some other aspects of the use of Latinos in this film bother me While some aspects of Victor Vargas are accurate others I have to question For example Victor Nino and Vicky all share the same room to sleep This set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what I believe Any selfrespecting Latino family wouldnt have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteenyear old girl At first I was unsure perhaps I was wrong but after speaking with my grandmother I knew my problem with this was justified Considering how conservative the grandmother is youd think that Vicky would have been sleeping in her roombr br As a Latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative Cuban household raised by my grandmother while my mother was working fulltime I could relate to the movie in many ways which is why my critical viewpoints are bittersweet because I really wanted to love this movie Unfortunately my lack of respect for Victor Vargas sabotaged my feelings for the film Maybe its because Victor Vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while I was playing with my Sega Genesis when I was seventeen Maybe its because without any further introspection by the film Victor Vargas is merely a stereotypical hotblooded Latino wholl just end up shouting to girls from his car Hey baybee ju want to get into my luv MahCheen Either way I dont like him so ultimately how can I like a film about him So if youll excuse me Im going to go stick my hands into a bowl of gritsbr br
0	br br I recently viewed this atrocity in my film program and I thought it was awful as I said in my tagline it was pretentious trite petty and phenomenally selfimportantbr br I consider myself a fan of film and all the things that film has to offer If I want to watch a documentary on the Cannes Festival I will watch AEand they would probably be alot more objective about itbr br I dont recommend it periodbr br
0	Other than the great cinematography by the marvelous James Wong Howe in the battle scenes this film is a true stinkerbr br This is the second film that Ive seen in recent days directed by Alexander Korda The first was Charles Laughtons Rembrandt It was so lousy that I shut it off This one Im afraid is not very much betterbr br Flora Robson is as ugly as ever as Queen Elizabeth Perhaps her performance as the virgin Queen was good for 1937 standards but when you compare it to that of a Helen Mirren it is absolutely no match In robotic fashion Robson states her lines Her battle message to the English troops is so lackluster in spiritbr br Even a dashing Laurence Olivier cant save this utter piece of boredombr br Future wife Vivien Leigh is in a supporting role here and she doesnt really convey anything here To think that Scarlett was 2 years laterbr br Its a shame that history with the Spanish Armada is made out to be so boring in this film
0	The first hour of the movie was boring as hell There is no suspense no action not even a plot The movie went no where I mean they could have made the movie in 15 min short film Overall the movie wasnt good at all and I dont recommend it
0	OK I know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as Watership Down is a classic and a standard part of most peoples childhood but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of 18 I must admit I really hated itbr br We watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it and many people who whimpered at the very words Watership Down their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams recommended it To be honest I wish I hadnt bothered I gave it the benefit of the doubt generally I dont like to stop watching a film half way through This was an exception It was really really excruciatingly sickeningly dull This film was possibly the slowest thing Ive ever watched imagine a dopedup snail in space and really didnt do it for me The art was alright the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly producedbr br Im not going to go into huge details about the storyline basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area Generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across For me I kind of wished that they would get gassed not because Im a horrible sadistic person but because the characters were uninspiring annoying dull and generally quite rude oh Im so terribly English I found that I was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened and even that was a terrible anticlimaxbr br If I were to praise it in any way Id have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite wellmeaning Maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy but the message its trying to put forth is good in its nature The musical score was not bad toobr br So to conclude this film is pretty poor I couldnt watch it the whole way through or Id probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom Granted it isnt Torque bad but it still doesnt rate highly in my eyes so Ive given it a 210br br Hope this helps
0	I rented this on DVD and I kind of feel bad since Dawson and Lugacy are so earnest about it in the DVD comments Its not a bad movie exactly but its one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre Plus it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways and the characters behavior often strains belief Id say its a film that you would get something out of if you dont have a lot of filmTVliteraturelife behind you to be honest Ive seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even Otherwise its point has been made before and more artfully And that gets to the big problem which is that it really doesnt have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point It ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling and it doesnt really pay off
0	Kirstie Alley looking a bit slimmer but only a bit is in this mess along with a man who is a MacGuyver lookalike bleached blond hair and all The premise of the movie is about an older woman 50 who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer Not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot There is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for Kirsties character and why this is included is a mystery The actor who portrays Kirsties brother is so wooden and miscast it was torture to watch their scenes What is there to say about this film Avoid it
1	Jimmy Cagney races by your eyes constantly in this story of a stageproducer who is vigorously struggling against the upcoming talking moviesbr br This story of love deceit women and dancing is presented in such a manner that as a viewer you are never treated to a dull moment The direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was enormously well done The story never really got lost in this frantic pacebr br Some parts of the material presented here have become a little dated but that doesnt matter because when you look at this in a 1933 timeframe it is fabulous to watch this next to a lot of the other drags of movies that were released during that timebr br Jimmy Cagney is a sight for sore eyes in this film never loosing his composure as the everworking producer of previews made for the movie theaters as intros In this way he tries to save his ass from going out of business he was a broadway producer before he started this Joan Blondell is fabulous as the neglected loveinterest Nan she gives such a spirited performance that is so unusual for movies of that time so cool to watch a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for a changebr br The only problem I had with the film were the enormous productions at the end These were magnificent in itself beautifully choreographed and wonderfully produced but they just didnt seem to fit in the story The only link they have to the main story is that Cagney had to put on 3 previews in 3 days to get a contract and thats what he did I had a hard time believing that this was what the girls had been rehearsing during the entire movie and that these sets could fit in a movie theater In this way the Sitting On A Backyard Fence was much more appropriate to the storybr br The productions at the end seemed to drag this frantically paced story to a halt and that was not a good thing I was tired after seeing the first Musical sequence and then I realized there were another two coming up These sequences got a lot a chuckles from the audience as wellbr br All in all a great film with a sour endingbr br 910
0	When it comes to horror movies I am more than willing to suspend disbelief ignore subpar production values and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare This movies simply has no good scares to offer It cant even be enjoyed as camp Bad dialogue bad acting bad direction the kills were predictable and poorly staged the music was annoying the camera work was wretched even the costumes were bad I felt really bad for the actors who were obviously trying but who had to deal with terrible contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction I doubt they got any rehearsal either Its embarrassing to watch and so boring than making it through to the contrived surprise ending requires tremendous endurance Its quite easily one of the worst movies Ive ever seenbr br I dont normally write reviews but this one was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others This movie is a complete waste of time If you must watch this movie dont miss the Making offeaturette The writerdirector seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold daring move Seen it He and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if its a newage Citizen Kane Its like listening to a group of thirdgraders take you behind the scenes of their Christmas pageant They truly think theyve created something of substance Its sad really The only reason I gave this movie a 2 is because I think 1 should be reserved for true atrocities like Manos Hands of Fate and Space Mutiny So American Nightmare isnt the WORST movie Ive ever seen but Id have to say that its somewhere in the bottom fifty
0	Well what can you say about a Barbara Cartland adaptationbr br There are some amazing actors in this Oliver Reed Sarah Miles Christopher Plummer but they clearly are clocking up the moneybr br Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland epics Anthony with Hugh Grant who looks suitably embarrassed and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carterbr br If you really want to see a watchable adaptation of Cartland the Bonham Carter one is the one to go for A Hazard of Hearts what a title Gilbert is the weak link in that but Bonham Carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek Edward Fox Diana Rigg
1	this is the best scifi that I have seen in my 29 years of watching scifi I also believe that Dark Angel will become a cult favorite The action is great but Jessica Alba is the best and most gorgeous star on TV today
1	This is a better than average silent movie and its still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents However if you arent yet a fan of the genre I suggest you try a few other films before watching this one Thats because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots But despite this its still a good film and kept my interestbr br A nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him The film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief Despite this she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life However the rent is due and theres no money so the lady is forced to look for work She becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal Unfortunately the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party cant make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the mans date Well like Cinderella she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her What to do nowgiven that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her Well see the movie yourself to see how its all resolved I DIDNT like how they handled the husband as it seemed awfully predictable and clichéd However once he was out of the way I do admire how the film also DIDNT give up a bythenumbers finale and left the film with a few loose endsbr br All in all a very good film worth seeing but certainly not great
0	This movie is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen From the very first scene i knew it would be a smash crash It starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission As it turns out the people in it were possessed by some random zombies Well some years later some college kids are pulling some pledge prank Horrible acting goes from pledge to the head jock Things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a nonchalonte manner with pledge over reacting and overdoing the whole eager to be popular role What really took the cake with this one is the final battle Absolutely HORRIBLE special effects with the guns For example guns making a noise with no muzzle flash and viceversa this is accompanied by stopanimation zombies why they move in stop motion is a mystery cheesy music and about 40 guns that come out of nowherebr br Overall this movie is crap Just like so many others you can rent for 50 cents at your nearest low brow movie rental place

0	If ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating its this pile of crap I love zombie films and even bad ones usually have something going for them but not this atrocity I actually began to feel angry watching this film because its so insultingly poor I cant believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptablebr br Theres no plot and the nonplot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking The people dont react act or in any way resemble human beings The entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be The whole thing is one pointless mess it doesnt go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and dont do very muchbr br I could make a better film than this so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before Its pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all timebr br Honestly the very worst movie of all time Youll note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a 1010 and urge you to BUY the DVD I cant imagine anyone neutral genuinely thinking this is a good film its terriblebr br 010 and thats generous
0	Bizarre take on the Cinderella tale Terribly poor script but Kathleen Turner turns in a pretty decent evil stepmother performancebr br Visually stunning in some parts but thats about it The period costumes range from the Elizabethan era to the 1990s Fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full 90 minutes of drivelbr br If youre really in the mood for a Cinderella story I suggest Ever After A Cinderella Story or The Glass Slipper
1	Probably my alltime favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but its not preachy or boring It just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years Paul Lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and Bette Davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight The kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch And the mothers slow awakening to whats happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling If I had a dozen thumbs theyd all be up for this movie
1	This is the first out of the Guinea Pig series and is one of the more infamous films out of the collectionbr br It took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films I bought the Guinea Pig Box Set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date So I popped this sucker in and sat downbr br From what I had read on the internet and realizing the content involved in this film I was expecting to test my nerves in full force This ended up not being the casebr br The film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point and how long a human can tolerate painbr br Sounds like one sick flick right Wrong The film fails to shock This may be because I have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror but I think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could sit through this with easebr br On the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen Though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence Including the ripping out of fingernails intestines thrown at an unconscious woman and a needle through the eyebr br Overall I think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it but I suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one
1	Most people who chase after movies featuring Audrey Tautou seem to not understand that Amelie was a character it is not really Audrey Tautous real life personality hence every movie she partakes in is not going to be Amelie part 2 part 3 etcbr br Now with that said I too picked up this movie simply because Audrey was in it Yes its true there is a big gap after the first scene where she isnt seen at all for maybe 45 min but I didnt even miss her because I was having so much fun with the other characters The guy who lies about everything is too funny the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss actually getting into all the characters here could take quite a while but this is one of the best movies Ive seen in a whilebr br Audrey Tautous character Irene is not the overdone sugary girl that Amelie was In fact as Irene her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first In this film Irene is a girl with good intentions but over the course of a very awful day her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimisticbr br What makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building very entertaining to watch great scenery and shots very colorful and never too slow and all of the characters can actually act The best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes left this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense and the whole butterfly effect blossoms I swear it was the best 20 minutes of film Ive seen in quite a while and the ending It made me think damn I really lucked out finding this movie The ending to this movie is top notch Whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant because not only are there all these other subplots going on but to somehow make them all tie in together and in a sensible manner which is the case here but also to make each character feel human and come alive not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect very impressivebr br I highly suggest this movie as its a great film to watch anytime in any mood with any company or alone
0	The animation in this reimagining of Peter the Wolf is excellent but at 29 minutes the film is sleep inducing They should have called it Peter the Snails because everything moves at a snails pace I couldnt even watch the film in one sitting I had to watch it 15 minutes at a time and it was pure torturebr br Save yourself 30 minutes do not watch this film and you will thank mebr br I can only guess that the Oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees Unfortunately to vote for the winner in the Best Animated Short short category the voters will have to sit through the whole thing I already feel sorry for them and must predict that theres no way this film will come close to winning
0	I grew up on Scooby Doo Where Are You and I still love it It is one of my favourite cartoons along with Darkwing Duck Talespin Peter Pan and the Pirates and Tom and Jerry This show though is good for kids the voices are goodDon Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect as Scooby and Shaggy the theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animation However it is rather disappointing I normally dont mind Scrappy but when he appears to be like the main character it gets annoying fast Complete with the catchphrase Puppy Power Scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual Also half the gang are missing after the first year somehow it didnt feel like Scooby Doo And the jokes and the story lines were in general lame and unoriginal very little chasing monsters or unmasking the baddies All in all not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby DooGet a Clue but this show is disappointing 410 for the animation voices theme tune and the fact it is nice for kids Bethany Cox
1	I enjoyed Still Crazy more than any film I have seen in years A successful band from the 70s decide to give it another try They start by playing some gigs in some seedy European venues with hilarious results The music is fantastic the script and acting are terrific The characters are spot on especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice makeup and personality problems The concert at the end was unreal Go and see it preferably in a cinema with a good sound system
0	Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors Im trying to view all of his work He has been known to singlehandedly save movies with his presence Unfortunately this is not one of them This movie suffers from a low budget and its production values are disturbing Pleasefor the love of Christopheravoid this film
0	In spite of the great futuredesign touches the clever Asimov premise and Will Smiths dependable cool performance this movie doesnt live up to expectations The clichés come thick and fast waking from a recurring nightmare maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant to list more would be spoiling it you can see the end a mile off This movie is also stagebound you never feel that you have travelled anywhere whats supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously CGI Chicago The robots themselves are good in closeup but the crowd scenes look more like bad Disney the CGI is overdone again and again And if you can destroy the robots by smashing them why do they need to inject nanites You know its a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax It could have been great but its less than the sum of its parts mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years

0	I cant believe that Steven Segals career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors I watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does When he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrongbr br The plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel youd be left wondering why you had even picked up the bookbr br Steven Segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation He shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesnt show up at allbr br I hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic The condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time The zappruder film showing President John F Kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleanerbr br My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds I read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget Segal being paid 5 of that and that the movie still came in under budget I must concurbr br It is no wonder that this is a direct to DVD movie as no conscientious theatre owner would play this movie
0	This may have been made for the hell of it but it was most probably the worst film ive seen in years The best thing about the entire DVD would be the case Im surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too Im glad i only rented I suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and Gothic to care about it without taking in any CGI or any other effects for that matter I hope Alex Chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and SFX to make a better film in the future that is if he is still in workbr br Notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing DONT BUY IT
1	I want Céline and Jessie go further in their relationship I want to tell them that they were made for each other that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other Their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached This is about love but not stupid things like in notting hills or those kind of movie This is life and i did believe in them i did believe they were falling This was so clever and touching I have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there I want to go to Vienna I want to see them as soon as possible againbr br I have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake a concept but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere somehow and some when something could really happenbr br Im french and didnt know very well July Delpy despite Kieslowski three colors white Now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect actingbr br i saw before sunset the sequel in Paris a few days before i saw before sunrise and their is no matter They are both masterpieces proof that you dont need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings Im sorry for my English which i m trying to bestbr br Franck in France
0	I found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film I managed to stomach 4550 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching Monster House instead which by the way is great funbr br The story has massive holes in it The plot line is hugely over stated and dull the acting is awful especially from Justin TImberlake who should really stick to what he is good at looking daft and singing like a castrato Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and Timberlake meet Freeman and Timberlakes characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of fatherson relationship of sorts or something which simply isnt evident at all apart from the fact that though Freemans character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of Timberlake he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover upbr br It would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportionbr br Dont watch this film it is a pure waste of time
1	A Vow to Cherish is a wonderful movie Its based on a novel of the same title which was equally good though different from the film Really made you think about how youd respond if you were in the shoes of the characters Recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent spouse or family memberin other words EVERYONEbr br Though the production isnt quite Hollywood qualityno big special effectsstill the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it And the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes illbr br You dont want to miss this

0	After some internet surfing I found the Homefront series on DVD at ioffercom Before anyone gets excited the DVD set I received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their TV 15 years ago The resolution and quality are poor The images look like you would expect old rerecorded video to look Although the commercials were edited out the ending credits of each episode still have voiceover announcements for the segway into the ABC news program Nightline complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990s Even with the poor image quality the shows were watchable and the sound quality was finebr br To this shows credit the casting was nearly perfect Everyone was believable and really looked the part Their acting was also above average The role of Jeff Metcalf is played particularly well by Kyle Chandler most recently seen in the 2005 remake of King Kong The period costumes were very authentic as were the sets especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and décor The direction was also creative and different for a TV show at that time For example conversations between characters were sometimes intercut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes The dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations That takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this casebr br As I started watching this series again I suddenly remembered why I lost interest in it 15 years ago Despite all the ingredients for a fine show the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start For one thing the name of the show itself is totally misleading When WWII ended in 1945 there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a homefront either Curiously the first episode of the show Homefront begins in 1945 after the war had ended Thats like shooting the first episode of Gilligans Island showing the castaways being rescued The whole premise of the shows namesake is completely lost I still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948 Additionally this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940s By the third episode it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra leftwing political agenda The show is set in River Run Ohio near Toledo However the shows ongoing racism theme makes it look more like Jackson Mississippi than Ohio Part of the ensemble cast are Dick Williams Hattie Winston and Sterling Macer Jr who portray the Davis family Much of the series shows the Davis family being discriminated against by the evil whites to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable The racism card has been played and over played by Hollywood now for over 40 years We get it Were also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis The subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show as it was for Homefront The acting talents of Williams Winston and Macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical frightened angry black family The wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in Ohio was a KKK member or something The racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fistfight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing and leave it at that Devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupidbr br In yet another ridiculous plot line the big boss of a local factory Ken Jenkins is portrayed as an Ebenezer Scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees The workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant procommunist propaganda message to the viewerbr br Personally I think this series had great potential The writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941  1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories Of course the loss of brothers sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama The situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or USO personnel passing through their town during training or enroute to Europe or the Pacific The possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless But no the writers of Homefront David Assael and James Grissom completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots Instead they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and leftwing politics It would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage

1	A lot has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true Miike film and I thought this sort of description might have been a cliché But like all clichés it is based on the truth All the Miike trademarks are here the violence the black humour the homosexuality the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character Shinjuku is however one of Miikes most perfectly formed films He says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different but not necessarily better I think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film br br As you might expect the violence is utterly visceral gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face Only a Miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that The film has a fantastic pace unlike Dead or Alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues Miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the Japanese and Chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past br br I cannot sing Shinjukus praises enough I do not want to give away too much This is Miike before he began to use CGI to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like Kitanos Sonatine The central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished youll be popping it back on again to work it all out
0	Frankly Im rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to Steven Smith I wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering Have they all been written by his pals The action clunks along the music is irritating and over used the script is simply dire and the actors with the exception of the gardener mediocre at best I do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying its brilliant when its not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again ie continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture Yes its his first film low budget etc I get it but its also out there for members of the public to purchase and its just not up to scratch

1	David Mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with House of Games a character study fraught with psychological overtones in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game Margaret Ford Lindsay Crouse has a successful practice and has written a bestselling novel Driven Still she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life theres an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve and it primes her vulnerability When a patient Billy Hahn Steven Goldstein confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers and that theyre going to kill him if he doesnt pay she decides to intervene on his behalf This takes her to the House of Games a seedy little dive where she meets Mike Joe Mantegna a charismatic conman who wastes no time before enticing her into his world Instead of the twentyfive large that Billy claimed he owed Mike shows her his book and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars And Mike agrees to wipe the slate clean if shell agree to do him one simple favor which involves a card game he has going on in the back room In the middle of a big hand Mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes while he is gone her job is to watch for the tell of one of the other players By this time not only Margaret but the audience as well is hooked The dialogue and Mamets unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines is mesmerizing As Mike leads Margaret through his compelling surreal realm of existence and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game we are swept right along with her From that first memorable encounter when he demonstrates what a tell is and how it works to the lessons of the short con to the stunning climax of this film Mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless And nothing is what it seems In the end Margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature and about herself She changes and whether or not its for the better is open to speculation Mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows and does Crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here you feel the rigid uptight turmoil roiling beneath that calm selfassured exterior and when her experiences with Mike induce the change in her she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated She makes you believe that she is capable of what she does and makes you understand it as well The dynamic supporting cast includes Mike Nussbaum Joey Lilia Skala Dr Littauer JT Walsh The Businessman Ricky Jay George and William H Macy Sergeant Moran House of Games is the quintessential Mamet hes written and directed a number of highcaliber plays and films since and will no doubt grace us with more in the future But this film will be the one that defines him and you can go to the dictionary and look it up Youll find it under Perfection This is one great movie you do not want to miss I rate this one 1010
1	I appreciated the photography the textures the colours and often unlike one comment the lighting What was lacking for me was a coherent storylineI found it often disjointed badly edited and at times difficult to follow My version was 110 minutes IMDb shows one at 125m Possibly the cuts and subtitles didnt help I applaud any films that escape from the Hollywood mould but this left me disappointed Miss Gillain was luminous and the performances were all fine I just wanted a little more dialogue If anyone would like to see another film that has some affinity with this one try Hideous Kinkywith Kate Winslet
1	This movie is as unique as it is overlookedA Different Story is just that it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind I first saw this on cable in the late 70s and it truly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time I believe this movie was ahead of its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life It is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family This film should be available on DVDVHS so that not only the extra ordinary performances of Meg Foster Perry King can be acknowledged but to show how far we have come still have to go where relationships are concerned
1	RUMORS is a memorable entry in the wartime series of instructional cartoons starring Private Snafu The films were aimed at servicemen and were directed animated and scored by some of the top talent from Warner Bros Termite Terrace including Friz Freleng Chuck Jones and Carl Stalling The invaluable Mel Blanc supplied the voice for Snafu and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by Theodor Geisel ie Dr Seuss The idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery using the character of Snafu as a perfect negative example he was the dope the little twerp who would do everything youre NOT supposed to do According to Chuck Jones the scripts had to be approved by Pentagon officials but Army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow all for the greater good of coursebr br As the title would indicate this cartoon is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors The setting is an Army camp Private Snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine something you wont see in any other Hollywood films of the era and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling We observe as an offhand remark about a bombing is misinterpreted then exaggerated then turned into an increasingly frightening rumor that sweeps the camp The imagery is indeed vivid the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot while the fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air ie balloon juice A soldier shoots his mouth off cannonstyle and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction Winged baloney at that Panicked soldiers tell each other that the Brooklyn Bridge has been pulverized Coney Island wiped out enemy troops have landed on the White House lawn and the Japanese are in California The visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for Rumoritis and Private Snafu has been locked up in a padded cellbr br This is a highly effective piece of work The filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy and the message is still a valid one In recent years weve seen that catastrophic events real or imagined can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances Because the technology has improved the Private Snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via email cellphones and blogging Consequently RUMORS is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesnt feel at all dated in fact it may be more timely than ever

handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly Sirens What who how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst 2The van will break down 3Whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about4They will find a house inhabited by a madman he will capture them 5 The house will have a phone but it will not work it will be disturbingly decorated there will be flickering neon light spiders and maggots 6The madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that wont start here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor 7The madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap weak scare and will then be killed properly 8Only a girl will be left alive from the group 9There will be an unnecessary twist at the end br br Add to these elements naked Sirens who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately that seduce and kill the teens throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream moviebr br I think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but I am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film Darkhunters which is one of the worst films I have ever seen At times the cinematography is very good the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies I was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity However the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again but amongst the DVD extrasbr br If you do rent this film I implore you to listen to the directors commentary it is beyond belief There is more to say about this than the film itself One staggering part of the commentary is the directors claim that the film is cliché leaden because it was a preconceived idea He says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichés and openly he wonders if people will get it br br Im afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichés within them then it is not wittily scripted enough acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work If this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question What was the point This is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies any attempt to do something clever or different havent workedbr br The next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats They rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use However the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when Michael Mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary There is a simple distinction to be made here Mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style Roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures I think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundantbr br The best moment is reserved for Roberts comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film Those who didnt like it are generalised as geeks and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that I must admit I was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasnt singled out for ridicule The tirade goes further as the group joke about Norwegian reviewers complete with hilarious accents to imply that people from Norway wouldnt know a good film simply because of where they are born As always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting they simply make the director and his friends look ignorantbr br The package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the Sirens were cast Roberts swears blind in voice over I didnt want to make a film that was like Baywatch as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground There is also a simpering selfindulgent documentary about the making of Darkhunters during which Roberts says that a reviewer has claimed that Forest is The best British film in years I dont know who he is trying to convince At one point in the commentary track Roberts says jokingly I can see people sitting at home saying this isnt amazing its sht he isnt wrong

0	Its one of those dramas thats so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny the script is absolutely dire direction appalling lighting purely armature the only thing letting it down from a true so bad its good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard but doesnt at least destroy any speeches Theres continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout And finally last but not least the acting is appalling For a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this
0	Cradle of Fearbr br This isnt a movie where intricate delicate little narrative nuances occupy our attention This is not a film where the special effects are supposed to leave us slackjacked uttering that sense of whoa What it is though is a slice of lofi goth horror which leaves little to the imagination created in the eyes of the director Alex Chandon as a throwback to sleazy 70s and 80s horrorbr br This is a very visceral experience for 2 hours where four plot lines are connected through lots of watery blood reams of dismembered body parts and innards tied by an intestinal thread of revenge br br The purveyor of such horrific violence is Dani Filth leadsinger of the metal band Cradle of Filth executing a role he was destined to play br br As others have said there is nothing new about wanting to carryout occultist revenge In this particular context a convicted sexual predator and murderer Kemper the father of our devilish avengingangel compels his son to exact retribution on those who are some how connected to convicting him to purgatory within an insane asylumbr br What this provides for the Chandon who should be congratulated on also penning and editing this piece is the opportunity to let his sick mind run free He seems to take delight in the idea of splattering blood into the orifices of those on screen and into every nook and cranny that can be reached We are also treated to closeups of skulls being crushed demonic rape and other assorted imagery to engage those who relish getting up close and personal to their horror And for some of those who closely follow these type of films there is the odd sequence which may have you thinking Did I just see what I thought I did because of course Pretty Woman this aint It reminds me of some of the gorefests created out of Italian horror some 20 to 30 years ago and a number of other works where disgusting images have left their mark but not the context in which they were viewedbr br Story 4 of the set is particularly intriguing where the idea of ones obsession can ultimately lead to death in the pursuit of internet violence through the Sick Room where the user is in control of how a life can be snuffed out Further acknowledgements should also go out to a pounding soundtrack that allows Filth to exercise his daytime talent and an effective use of drum and bass often overlooked in filmmaking as a viable form of supporting visuals Using the city of London as a backdrop with real people as opposed to movie standins also adds support to the commando feel of the film OK classic it may not be but blood guts intestines occult and demons in a slightly perverse unproblematic way it is
0	I cant really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on Asimov than the art direction Forget the product placement disaster the unconvincing performance from Will Smith and the gargantuan plotholes This wasnt only laughable and but painful to watch Even the action was boring A mixture of MTV inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small childrenbr br What a shame that scifi this bad can still be made after weve had Bladerunner Minority Report or to a lesser extent Dark City by the same director This one really belongs in the bottom 100 list Truly awful
0	My guess is that this directorwriter had something to say Lets see what it could have been a Frog storms would be creepy b can I get someone like Tom Cruise to say the C word many times and look like a bad Patrick Rafter c Cast my wife and get her to say the F word every 2 seconds This aside I really liked the beginning and the frog storm The rest was a relentless overlong underedited overindulgent failure Glad so many of you enjoyed it br br
0	How can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up With enough cops to run a miniwar that include such weapons as flamethrowers you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying thanks to a corrupt copbr br You will never get your 90ish minutes back Life is too precious to rent this moviebr br I feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this moviebr br If you like Justin Timberlake feel free to rent this movie He does have a very major part in it so fans might enjoy seeing him br br However I believe most of his fans are young girls who may be turned off by the violence in this movie
0	Ive now written reviews for several of the MoH episodes and this is among the worst An interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll If watching people things they never would in real life amuses you lets check out the basement then this is your show Except its not amusing or entertaining its just annoyingbr br The extent of the virus is never ever showed I can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only as the resulting situation is very very frightening But then things deteriorate as daughter lets OBVIOUSLY deranged dad into the home and ultimately dies at his hands The woman flees north and runs into a few tens situations Then some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her things that make you go HUH Or something Then she is huddling for warmth The endbr br Awful These directors are mailing this tripe in

0	Im a Christian I have always been skeptical about movies made by Christians however As a rule they are knownothings when it comes to movie production I admire TBN for trying to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen However they did a hideous job of it The acting was horrible and unless one is familiar with the Bible in some fashion one COULD NOT have understood what the movie was trying to get across Not only was the movie terribly made but the people who made it even had some facts wrong However in this critique those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into In short the Omega Code is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen and I would not recommend it to anyone except for comic relief from the every day grind
0	Being a filmmaker myself and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour I thought I was in for a treat when I took home My Wrongs not that the DVD cover gives anything away instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director Chris Morris a short film including scenes I should have known better really and avoided this insipid and often offensive piece of twoddlebr br The scene in the church is repulsive to watch especially since we are all too familiar with Morriss warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious TV series Brass Eye and serves no purpose other than to shock How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understandbr br The runners commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle having been a runner myself its often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process however this is sadly not the case here Instead we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs This is all very interesting but not worth a single frame of celluloidbr br To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style at the expense of plot character and dialogue leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled Its oversimplified message that man should take responsibility for his actions is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustratedbr br The film does have its moments of pseudoKafkaesque surrealism but ultimately it fails to convince to entertain to enlighten and just ends up being irritating If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking I strongly recommend Franz Kafkas Its A Wonderful Life by Peter Capaldi
0	OK I am not Japanese I do know a little about Japanese culture and a little less about Japanese pop culture Other than that I am Spanish I eat paella and I like black humorbr br Good with that point set I can comment on the movie I have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the Japanese audiences Mamoru Oshii is quite a good director despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of Talking Head and even that was curious and somehow interesting and I am surprised he came up with this It may just be one of those lostintranslation cases I am afraid it is but as a European viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded English subtitles I just thought it was horrible The jokes seemed bad the script was overcooked I mean give the audience a break and shut up a little you damn narrator to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fastpaced speaking and absurd actionbr br However I thought the animation was really cool The idea is great and it is well exploited in those animated scenes However the eyecandy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbojumbo speech over still pictures It just makes you want to fast forward to the next cutout hysterical characters scenebr br I read Mamoru Oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this The idea was good but horribly exploited Maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie or maybe it will be more and more overnarrated scenes But hell if you thought Talking Head was dense Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters will give cause you a strokebr br Of course all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is European Probably this is totally useless to Japanese people maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation Maybe
1	This film is the best film Jim Carrey has ever made Carrey did not have his usual face making stuff in this film He was both funny and sad Carrey played a reporter named Bruce Nolan Nolan blames GodMorgan Freeman for everything that goes wrong in his life Then God comes down from heaven and gives Bruce his powers As I said before Carrey did an excellent job I also thought that Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great as supporting actoractress The plot was good because it had many subpoints in the main point This movie can be funnyBruces dog as well as sadthe breakup The script worked well too I am glad they made a sequel to this film I rate this film a 910
0	Having seen men Behind the Sun I guess I hoped for an evolution in style technique to match the larger scale of this movie I was also quite interested to see someone make a hardhitting factbased fictionalised account of what happened during this most notorious of Japanese atrocities but this is not it This plays like a bottomtomid tier European Nazi exploitation movie from the 70s eg SS Experiment Camp etc perhaps more like Deported Women of the Special Section actually Granted it has a greater scope and more people running around but it resorts to the same cheap and cheerless device of lots of hapless nonactors limply falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake gunshots spiced up with the occasional poorly executed shock sequence The admittedly horrible documentary footage is roughly spliced in between scenes so hackneyed that even these real images are robbed of much of their power Watch channel 4s The Holocaust aired recently still running as of 1 No 2006 for a genuinely disturbing documentary on the evils of war featuring excellent incontext use of actual footage This is the type of treatment the horror of Nanjing deserves not this hackneyed exploitation garbage a better executed exploitation movie minus the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been fine but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie Rating 3 5 as exploitation 1 as a treatment of the subject
1	I havent written a review on IMDb for the longest time however I felt myself compelled to write this When looking up this movie I found one particular review which urged people NOT to see this film Do not pay any attention to this ignorant person NOTHING is a fantastic film full of laughs and above all imagination Arent you sick and tired of being force fed the same old cycle of bubblegum trash movies Sometimes a film like NOTHING comes along and gives you something you have never seen before I dont even care if you dislike even hate the movie but no one has a right to discredit the film IMDb has a monumental impact on reputations and no negative review should discredit the film like that Just say you hate it and why you hate it but dont try to tell people that they shouldnt watch it We have minds of our own and will make up our own minds thank youbr br If my judgment is any good Id say that more people will enjoy this movie as opposed to those who hate itbr br Treat your mind to a bit of eyecandy See NOTHING
0	I am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie rocked It is pure CG overacted CRAP Dont send an Assassin its much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored aggressive venomous Snakes on a Plane The only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to It is not so bad its good Its so bad Id rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again I honestly thought was going to be a COMEDY like AIRPLANE A spoof Was I wrong Its that whole It sucks get it Or Samuel A Jackson yells Snakes on the Plane thing Well Im sorry I dont get it It looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like Triple X and Die Hard If you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought William Hungs CD still live in their mommies basement and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn then rush to the theater and ask for one since I doubt you have a girlfriend ticket for Snakes on a stupidbutt Plane To hell with movies like Full metal Jacket Pulp Fiction True Romance 12 Monkeys Clerks etc Theres no irony in watching good movies The true decline of the western civilization Calling this a cult film is an Insult to true Cult classics like Repo man or even Orgazmo Ive said enough here

0	The author sets out on a journey of discovery of his roots in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the completely and deservedly forgotten movie Bright Leaf is about an ancestor of his Its not and he in fact discovers nothing of even mild interest in this absolutely silly and selfindulgent glorified home movie suitable for screening at the directors drunken family reunions but certainly not for commercial or even noncommercial release A good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by major studios because they are boring irrelevant and of no interest to anyone but the director and hisher immediate circles Avoid at all costs
0	Normally when I go on a raid of the local Hollywood Video I head towards the BHorror movies To me the basic principals behind a BHorror movie is its camp value Heavy Gore Lots of needless Nudity and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex I rented Cradle of Fear strictly because Ive been a fan of the band since they released theyre first Demo in 1995 The movie started off on an interesting note and then when I saw Dani Filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask I LAUGHED When I saw the Lesbian sex scene for the sake of a Lesbian sex scene I LAUGHED EVEN HARDER I spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when I wasnt laughing I was shaking my head thinking about how a multimillion dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multihundreds of dollars The whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the Hardcore Goth kids who think death destruction sex blood and Satan are the greatest things invented since Lava Lamps That was really it To me this movie seemed like 805 of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being Satanic This movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this Movie really is just an extended Cradle of Filth Video
1	An utterly beautiful film one of a handful of I saw when young that entranced me then and still do in Thiefs case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time By the 90s my daughter and I had seen it many times on TV but still went to the pictures when it came to the local arthouse cinema  when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and Miklos Rozsas stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was againbr br Idealistic Prince Ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out but evil Vizier Jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne After escaping with a little thief played by Sabu Ahmad spots a Princess and they fall blindingly in love  along the way they have many adventures although apparently not enough for Sabu and Love not only conquers but annihilates everything The special effects must have been mesmerising in 1940 but Time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action  but they still hold up well compared against films like Superman from 40 years later Anyway if Im requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies flying horses and carpets I also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects Favourite bits the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when Ahmad reveals himself and Adelaide Halls suitably romantic song the stunning colours in the tent in the Land Of Legend  in fact the stunning colours throughout Sabu and Rozsas triumphant but still wistful finale Conrad Veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever this and Casablanca and then died John Justin and June Duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted but the parts didnt call for a huge range of emotions only pure love matteredbr br Theres a couple of mildly violent images in it but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a 100 positive message its only a pity that nowadays little kids dont watch this instead of the porn they prefer One of my Top 10 film favourites I cant recommend this too much  may it be shown to the end of Time
1	Footlight Parade is fascinating on so many levels There is no way the supposedly staged theater prologues could have been produced in any theater on earth of course Think of the huge pools and threestory tall fountains for By A Waterfall for instance Berkeley directed John Garfield in They Made Me a Criminal six years later and had the Dead End Kids singing By a Waterfall as they took their showers br br Shanghai Lil is the best production number in the picture Its a catalog of 30s Warner Bros sensibilities Note the African guys mixed into the scene with white and Asian prostitutes You would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house Here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others I also get a thrill when the military dancers do a card section presentation of Roosevelts image Theres also the NRA eaglethe logo of the controversial National Recovery Administration of the New Deal FDR was the new president and hopes were so high that hed pull the nation out of the Depression Youd never see something so working class oriented coming out of MGM of course Warner Bros wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the FDR administration br br Dear little Miss Ruby Keeler was never better than she is playing the Chinese hooker Lil She hardly even watches her feet as she dances which was one of her signature flaws br br The PreCode stuff is fun The By a Waterfall number is wonderful in that regard The girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through Times Square with all its lights on The spreadeagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for 35 years In a few months the Production Code would eliminate such naughty pleasures

0	I dont want to go too far into detail because I cant really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film but I had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie The animation is crud and the story alternates between boringpointless to extremely irritating The humor was completely lost on the audience and yes Ghost in the Shell fans this is NOT an action scifi or anything like that its an attempt at slapstick comedy and the humor just did not work after being translated It was a total chore to watch this movie and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest especially considering how excited I was and how open I was for anything I wasnt expecting a Ghost in the Shell sequel but I was expecting something entertaining and it simply didnt achieve this Yaaawwnnn Rent Kinos Journey instead
0	Where to start This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen The editing is the worst ever the sound effects were awful and the sound editing was whacked Most of the movie all one could here is the crappy kicking effects with muddled talking in the background I had to turn my volume on full blast just to her what was going onand what was I supposed to hear exactly Probably one of the worst scripts ever made I cant believe people actually put up some green for this film It makes me think I could take a crap in a box send it to producers and then have them finance a movie for mebr br Dolph was a usual Dolph Nothing else needs to be said The villains were bad the protagonists were bad and the movie was a stinker If you really want to know what NOT to do when either writing directing or editing a movie watch this

0	You can give JMS and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget but the movie is still subpar Dont get me wrong B5 the series is by far the best TV series ever but if i was an exec seeing this movie i wouldnt have ordered the series I dont like OHare as an actor the costumes are silly and there are tons of cliches The same can be said for most of the first season with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors Bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle If you are a B5 fan and havent seen this movie see it If you arent a B5 fan dontyou wont want to watch the series

0	This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen While featuring good actors the movie doesnt live up to the expectations The most dramatic thing about this movie is the music which pretty much sums up the movie compensating for a bad and confusing storyline by having knowngood actors loud and dramatic music It doesnt change the fact that this is a very boring movie to watch Earned itself a score of 1

1	A CRY IN THE DARK br br A CRY IN THE DARK was a film that I anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and a solid if unremarkable film This assumption came from the fact that aside from Streeps Best Actress nomination the movie received little attention from major awards groupsbr br Little did I anticipate that A CRY IN THE DARK would be such a riveting drama wellconstructed on every level If you ask me this is an underappreciatted classicbr br The film opens rather slowly letting the audience settle into the Chamberlains at a relaxed pace and really notice that at the core they are an incredibly loving simple family Fred Schepisi the director selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy while also showing the attentive bliss with which Lindy Streep and Michael Sam Neill Chamberlain care for their childrenbr br While the famous line A Dingo Took My Baby has become somewhat of a punchline these days the movie never even comes close to laughable The actual death of Azaria is horrifyingly captured It is subtle and realistic leaving the audience horrified and asking questionsbr br The majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the Chamberlains continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court which suspects Lindy of murderbr br The fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping As an audience member I was fully invested in the Chamberlains plight and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media But at the same the mediapublic opinion is understandable I loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic but they always had valid reasons to hold their viewsbr br The final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramasbr br In terms of performances the only ones that really matter in this film are those of Streep and Neill and they deliver in every way For me this ranks as one of if not 1 Meryl Streeps best performances For all her mastery of different accents which of course are very impressive in their own right Streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters I find this to be one of Streeps more subtle performances and she hits it out of the park And Neill an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in JURASSIC PARK is a perfect counterpoint to Streeps performance From what Ive seen this is undoubtedly Neills finest work to date Its a shame he wasnt recognized by the Academy with a Leading Actor nomination to match Streeps bc the two of them play of each other brilliantlybr br More emotionally gripping than most films and also incredibly suspenseful A CRY IN THE DARK far exceeded my expectations I highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where Meryl screams The dingo took my baby watch the film and see just how much more there is to A CRY IN THE DARK then that one linebr br A

0	This 1996 movie was the first adaptation of Jane Eyre that I ever watched and when I did so I was appalled by it So much of the novel had been left out and I considered William Hurt to be terribly miscast as Rochester Since then I have watched all the other noteworthy adaptations of the novel the three short versions of 44 70 and 97 and the three mini series of 73 83 and 2006 and I have noticed that there are worse adaptations and worse Rochestersbr br This is without doubt the most exquisite Jane Eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned Director Franco Zerifferelli revels in beautiful long shots of snow falling from a winter sky of lonely Rochester standing on a rock and of Jane looking out of the window but he is less good at telling a story and bringing characters to life In addition his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes As a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between Jane and Rochester and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their intercourse There are a number of short conversations between Rochester and Jane each of them beautifully staged but the couple of sentences they exchange do not suffice to show the audience that they are drawn to each other We know that they are supposed to fall in love but we never see it actually happen The scene in which Rochester wants to find out Janes reaction to his dilemma by putting his case in hypothetical form before her after the wounded Mason has left the house is completely missing and the farewell scene the most important scene the climax of the novel is reduced to four sentences Zerifferelli does not make the mistake other scriptwriters have made in substituting their own poor writing for Brontës superb lines neither are crucial scenes completely changed and rewritten but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out What remains is just a glimpse of the novel which does no justice to Charlotte Brontës masterpiecebr br The cast is a mixed bag While Fiona Shaw is an excellent Mrs Reed Anna Paquins young Jane is more an illmannered pout Lolita than a lonely little girl longing for love The everreliable Joan Plowright makes a very likable but far too shrewd Mrs Fairfaix and one cannot help feeling that Billie Whitelaw is supposed to play the village witch instead of plainlooking hardworking Grace Poole Charlotte Gainsbourgh as the grownup heroine however is physically a perfect choice for playing Jane Eyre Looking every bit like 18 thin and frail with irregular strong features she comes closest to my inner vision of Jane than any other actress in that role And during the first 15 minutes of her screen time I was enchanted by her performance Gainsbourgh manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask But unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of Janes character any further As a result of leaving out so many scenes and shortening so much of the dialogues Gainsbourghs portrayal of Jane must necessarily remain incomplete and therefore ultimately unsatisfactory This is a pity as with a better script Charlotte Gainsbourgh might have been as good a Jane as Zelah Clarke in the 83 versionbr br But while it is still obvious that Gainsbourgh is trying to play Jane there is no trace whatsoever of Rochester in the character that William Hurt portrays Hurt who has proved himself to be a fine actor in many good movies must have been aware that he was physically and typewise so miscast that he did not even attempt at playing the Rochester of the novel His Rochester besides being blond and blueeyed is a softspoken wellmannered nobleman shy and quiet slightly queer and eccentric but basically goodnatured and mild He is so far from being irascible moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous Additionally during many moments of the movie Hurts facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against acute attacks of the sleeping sickness Particularly in the proposal scene he grimaces like a patient rallying from a general anaesthetic and is hardly able to keep his eyes open If you compare his Rochester to the strongwilled and charming protagonist of the novel simply bursting with energy and temperament it is no wonder that many viewers are disappointed in Hurts performance Still he offends me less than the Rochesters in the 70 97 and 2006 versions and I would in general rank this Jane Eyre higher than these three other ones Hurt obviously had the wits to recognise that he could not be the Rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so whereas George C Scott Ciaràn Hinds and Toby Stephens thought they could but failed miserably and Id rather watch a character other than Rochester than a Rochester who is badly played And Id rather watch a Jane Eyre movie which leaves out many lines of the novel but does not invent new ones than a version which uses modernised dialogues which sound as if they could be uttered by a todays couple in a Starbucks café Of course this Jane Eyre is a failure but at least it is an inoffensive one which is more than one can say of the 97 and 2006 adaptations I would therefore not desist anyone from watching this adaptation You will not find Jane Eyre but at least you will find a beautifully made movie
0	Might contain possible spoilers Not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matterbr br Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion Sure its cheaper for them but after a while wouldnt you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off House Of Villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all Some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are The voices dont even remotely match up and Iago is evil again Since when I know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy Disney films Even the movies musical number which had been Disneys specialty for years stunk I wouldnt recommend this film to anyone even the very young All I can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released its only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses Disney in overall quality
0	When childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie its touch and go whether you should revisit it Anyway I remembered a scary scene involving a homeless person and a cool villain played by Jeff Koberbr br The First Power is not a very good movie sad to say Its chock full of those cop clichés and a very poor script with holes a truck could drive through along with countless convenient twists that help the story run along Lou Diamond Phillips is the overconfident bad ass cop who sends baddie serial killer Kober to the gas chamber only to find out he was a minion of Satan himself and now has the power of resurrection along with the power of possessing every weak minded person who he comes across Through in the mix a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the casebr br Ahhh this is trash But enjoyable as such especially if you have fond memories of it It scared me as a kid and that scene with the homeless person is still pretty good As for any kind of logic here forget it just about every scenario is thrown in for good measure and you end up with a cross between a Steven Segal action flick and a 70s demonic flick And who on earth thought it was a good idea to cast Lou Diamond Phillips in the lead here Needless to say hes not convincing at all but he tries his best and Ive never had the problem with the guy so many reviewers here seem to have As for Tracy Griffith as the psychic the less said the better But Kober is pretty good as the killer always liked that actorbr br The First Power may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard days work and a brain switchoff is needed Beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience and Ill definitely have loads of it the next time I give this movie a spin All in all not a good flick but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared as kids See you around buddy boy
1	I first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick Snuff I was told that Devils Experiment was much better so naturally I went ahead and ordered the Guinea Pig box set I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one so my interest was peakedbr br Devils Experiment is a short film with no story no character development Just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes They torture her in various ways like beating her spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol forcing her to listen to hipitched noise for 24 hours smash her hand with a mallet burning and putting maggots on the burns throwing guts at her and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eyebr br I must say that a lot of this movie was fake like the beating scenes But then some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out The scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about The worst is the eye scene I didnt shutter when watching it but simply thought Damn that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie I did enjoy the flick but I dont know if I can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer 710
1	If you have any clue about Jane Austen´s production you´ll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels marriage marriage and marriage In my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring but I like Austen´s characters because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in Emma The thing that makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow she´s very good in her leading role Also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie don´t seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious
0	This movie is one long chiche after another First of all though they did their share there is a unwarranted dope scene where John sniffs weed like an idiot The wigs and accents are terrible They sound worse then the old Beatle cartoons John is the nasty envious closet homosexual slave to Yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited Albert Goldman book They even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation it was always just the Two Of Us John would not have been mean to his fans like this either Like his death showed us he was too nice if anything The one funny scene is where a dumb Beatle fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing Pauls Yesterday An insulted John says something along the lines of Sure and while I croon why dont you get down on your knees put on your wifes wig and lick my liggin That made me laugh for days Really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous John and Paul also did not sit pontificating all day they were funny light hearted guys who even during The Beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here Forget it
0	This show is terrible the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse I am one of those people who was never a big fan of Corner Gas but at least I liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them Well at least Corner Gas was good at first Little Mosque on the Prairie is typically awful bland CBC comedy that had nothing going for it from episode 1 Who are the people who are watching this show anyway I am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies Maybe the jokes are for them and they work there I dont know a single person who likes this show and cant stand it myself the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in Corner Gas Hopefully it wont last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being Muslim which is different and couldshould have led to a great show
0	I have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the Wrinkle in Time Chronicles My dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading A Winkle in Time and would think what an amazing movie this would make Sadly enough that screenwriter failed changing characters throwing in lame humor and all out destroying the plot I know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie But why cant you stay true to the book Why must you change the way characters think and act For those of you who have not read the book pick it up find a soft couch and let your imagination run wild
0	A lot of people seemed to have liked the film so I feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review But after sitting through 96 minutes of it I feel I have to do so Where the heck is the plot in this film I must have missed it I was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened Sure the ending was somewhat shocking but they didnt build up to it I forgot who was who half of the time so they didnt really develop the characters The acting was soso most of the time it was believable but I was able to see through it most of the time So without giving anything away I must say that unless you like the actors in the film there is no real reason to watch this movie I could be mistaken but I just didnt understand why there was so little or too much of the film I cant decide which one that would be so I say judge for yourselves I dont even know if renting it would be a good idea the cost and all br br Plot 010 Characters 110 Acting 210 Overall 310 I feel like thats too high really I am staying with my vote up at the top
0	The film is bad There is no other way to say it The story is weak and outdated especially for this country I dont think most people know what a walker is or will really care I felt as if I was watching a movie from the 70s The subject was just not believable for the year 2007 even being set in DC I think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end Most didnt stay for the QA eitherbr br I dont think Schrader really thought the film out ahead of time Many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didnt know how to finish them He jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on I really didnt get Woodys Carter private life or boyfriend either What were all the artistic male bondage and torture pictures from Iraq prisons about What was he thinking I think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for Woodys character Car It didnt work It didnt even seem to make sense reallybr br The only good thing about this film was Woody Harrelson He played his character Car flawlessly You really did get a great sense of what a walker may have been like say twenty years ago He was great and most likely will never get recognized for it br br As for Lauren Lily and Kristin Boringbr br Dont see it It is painful Unless you are a true Harrelson fan
1	Back in 1997 do I remember that year Clinton bans cloning research the unfortunate death of Princess Diana the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets This was also the big year in the release of Titanic one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster I dont think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans 85 of them being teenage girls I was 12 years old at the time and of course saw the movie multiple times It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong of course I grew up and didnt watch the film since I was 14 a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 599 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now Was it worth the hype Was it really the best movie of all time Was that Leonardos real nose OK I know thats silly to say but I did rewatch the film Being completely honest here Titanic is a great movie best movie of all time no just depends on your idea of a good movie but Titanic delivered in romance humor disaster emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyagebr br The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean Unsuccessful they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude wearing the Heart of the Ocean dated the day the Titanic sank 101yearold Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing She and her granddaughter Elizabeth Lizzy Calvert visit Lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater In 1912 the upperclass 17yearold Rose boards the ship with her fiancé Cal Hockley and her mother Ruth DeWitt Bukater both of whom stress the importance of Roses engagement to Cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the DewittBukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upperclass Rose and her mother are financially broke Distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling Cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern Before she leaps a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy firstclass formal dinner of the rapportbuilding wealthy for a much livelier gathering of Irish dance music and beer in thirdclass But after Cals servant informs him of Roses whereabouts Rose is forbidden from seeing Jack again However after witnessing a woman encouraging her sevenyearold daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea Rose defies him and her mother asking Jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the Heart of the Ocean an engagement present from Cal After a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time they go to the deck of the shipbr br They then witness the ships fatal collision with an iceberg After overhearing the ships lookouts discussing how serious the collision is Rose tells Jack they should warn her mother and Cal Meanwhile Cal discovers Roses nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe so he frames Jack for stealing the Heart of the Ocean by having Lovejoy plant it in Jacks pocket Upon learning Cal intends to leave Jack to die below deck Rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him Jack and Rose return to the top deck Cal and Jack though enemies both want Rose safe so they persuade her to board a lifeboat But after realizing that she cannot leave Jack Rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with Jack in the ships first class staircase Jack and Rose return to the top deck the lifeboats have gone and the ship finally goes down into the freezing Atlantic taking Jack and Rose downbr br So does Titanic live up to its hype I still say that this is a great movie to watch I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie But it has great acting amazing effects a wellwritten story and still looks flawless Love it or hate it you have to admit this movie didnt get a lot of hype just because of Leos baby face or Kates amazing ability to cry on sight this film is something special It will always hold a special place in my heart it has too seeing that I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released But all that aside I do recommend this movie its a great one and sure to go down in the classics one daybr br 1010
1	Let me get the bad out of the way first James Hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to act his descriptions of what was going on with the rookie training and events of the day Really it is in stark contract to the other fire fighters without acting aspirations who are natural in their deliverybr br That said it is an amazing film that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes I am an English guy from London but I love New York and have visited many many times before and after September 11th It is a second home to me and I cant help but feel devastated at the loss of life but also the destruction of part of such an amazing beautiful city This is the real deal in with the fire fighters with everything collapsing around them I am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was on the day It is a shame that they didnt use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me this is such a major part of their memory it should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really wasbr br Conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way
0	Having read the novel before seeing this film I was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot I feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of Brontes work and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story In the condensing of the film to a short 2hours the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding There is no build up to the romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their love is superficial This is such an injustice to Brontes novelyou are given no impression of Janes quirky cheek and boldness which attracts Rochester to her and his arrogance which attracts Jane to himbr br Despite to poor scripting I think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely namely Mrs Fairfax and Grace Poole however overall the production was poor Given a better scripting perhaps the film would have been more successful See Jane Eyre 1970 with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for an outstanding production
1	After a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century Australian street we meet Julie Rebecca Gibney and Peter John Adam as they go out house hunting They manage to get a loan for a fixerupper on a posh Sydney street but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home It just may be hauntedbr br 13 Gantry Row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by Catherine Millar into a slightly above average shockerbr br The biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly excusable to that hurdle A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film The opening thriller scene features some wonky editing Freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that theres not much action Suspense should be created from staging not fancy fix it in the mix techniques There is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing proximity The tracking and the cuts need to be slow The attack needed to be longer clearer and better blocked As it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at thatbr br After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves The story has a lot of similarities to The Amityville Horror 1979 though the budget forces a much subtler approach Millar and scriptwriter Tony Morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effectsoriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wallbr br For some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama At least the first half hour of the film is primarily about Julie and Peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in But Morphett writes fine intelligent dialogue The material is done well enough that its often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise laterespecially if youve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own housebr br Once they get settled and things begin to get weirder even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good The performances help create tension There isnt an abundance of death and destruction in the filmtheres more of an abundance of home repair nightmares But neither menace is really the pointbr br The point is human relationships There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it That its in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe such as money or health problems Peters character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal workbased friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful At the same time we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be Julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationshipbr br Although 13 Gantry Row never quite transcends its madefortelevision clunkiness as a TV movie this is a pretty good one with admirable ambitions Anyone fond of haunted house films psycho films or horrorthrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy It certainly isnt worth spending 30 for a DVD that was the price my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling but its worth a rental and its definitely worth watching for free
1	Personally I find the movie to be quite a good watch It outlines the actual situation of triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organizedbr br Not only that it also shows the viewer how the Hong Kong police control the triad situation and why the police dont just go all out and wipe out triadsbr br Overall the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings torture Nevertheless the movie stays true to the real world thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happensbr br Id recommend this movie to any TriadMafia movie fan Another good watch would be Dragon Squad That movie has more guns than this as in this movie theres more knives than guns in fact I dont remember seeing a single gun

1	im not even sure what to say about this film its one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa like dancing about architecture it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie Adaptation wanted to write the ending is left open and ambiguous no happy ending here just mystery no profound life lessons just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings romantic lovebr br 10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger
0	This is quite possibly the worst movie of all time It stars Shaquille ONeil and is about a rapping genie Apparently someone out there thought that this was a good idea and got suckered into dishing out cash to produce this wonderful masterpiece The movie gets 1 out of 10
1	As we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known The two leads always have to get together Late in the third act I was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together A clue was given right from the start but youll never realize it until the end Its a simple hook but it works It Had To Be You cover a lot of the usual ground but takes a fresh spin when ever possible I liked all the NY characters and I loved the locations Its a postcard of NY Also it was nice to watch a film and not find anything offensive in it So if you like a good old fashion romantic movie then this is for you
1	Im not great at writing reviews so Ill just spout my opinionsbr br I loved this series at first The adventure the action the comedy the drama I thought it was all brilliant Anderson Tapping Shanks Judge Davis I loved them all Davis it seemed was the fifthmost important person in the cast Not a big deal But when his character General Hammond left at the end of the seventh season and Andersons character Colonel ONeill moved from the field to the office the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff I dont know whether its because Hammond was more important that I realized or what but for some reason after the seventh season the series turned to br br The first seven seasons though were awesome The movie Stargate seemed mediocre the first time I saw it but it turned out to be even if this wasnt the original intention a brilliant setup to the series I recommend that you watch the movie first then watch the first season of the TV series then watch the movie again youll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around believe me and then watch the rest of the TV seriesbr br The last three seasons of the series arent nearly as good as the first seven but that doesnt mean they arent good It just means theyre a letdown if youve gotten spoiled by the first seven seasonsbr br After you have finished this series be sure to watch the spin off series Stargate Atlantis It is a worthy successor to this brilliant seriesbr br EDIT on 71808 I just found out that Don S Davis died a few weeks ago It is a great loss
1	I was in a bad frame of mind when I first saw this movie For some reason it clicked on all my levels tensions in a family loneliness and the want of someone to share your life with It didnt hurt that the someone to share your life with was such a beautiful girl as Claire Cyndy Preston I also bought the sound track to this movie very hard to get Loved it and hope it will someday come out on DV

1	This is a great little film thats very unique and creative with some great plot twists and wonderful performances All the characters are great and the story while bizarre is fascinating and very interesting plus Nicole Kidman is simply amazing in this Its very hard to describe this movie because it really is quite bizarre its a comedyromance one minute then it turns into a thriller the next however it was still very entertaining all the same plus Nicoles Russian accent was fantastic and extremely convincing Chaplin and Kidman had very good chemistry together and i loved Vincent Cassels performance plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise The ending was very cute and its unpredictable throughout plus this movie is quite underrated as well You will feel sorry for Chaplin and the way that he is scammed and i thought all the characters were really likable plus the finale is especially goodThis is Nicoles movie though and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance This is a great little film thats very unique and creative with some great plot twists and wonderful performances i highly recommend this one The Direction is very good Jez Butterworth does a very good job here with great camera work solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace The Acting is wonderful Nicole Kidman is stunningly gorgeous and is amazing as always she is incredibly sexy very likable had one of the coolest accents added a lot of presence had very good chemistry with Ben Chaplin and had a very mysterious character she was amazing Kidman Rules Ben Chaplin is great here he is extremely likable had a cool character had very good chemistry with Kidman the only thing i didnt like was him taking out his anger out on Kidman even though what she did was wrong and i loved how he got revenge in the end Vincent Cassel is fantastic as the main villain yes he was OTT but he was very intense and quite creepy at times this role was perfect for him Mathieu Kassovitz is OK here but didnt have much to do Rest of the cast are fine Overall i highly recommend this one 12 out of 5
1	I absolutely LOVED this film I do not at all relate to all the other comments I have read about it I was COMPLETELY enthralled through every second br br I found the story gripping the acting intense and the direction spoton I would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie Even though there was nothing scary about the story itself I was soundly on edge through the whole movie and for the rest of my evening br br I found that there were so many perfect choices madethe casting the script the little bits of humor sprinkled in it There were so many points where the film couldve gone for the cheap thrill but it never did and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out latelyand for the last number of years
0	This 30 minute documentary Buñuel made in the early 1930s about one of Spains poorest regions is in my opinion one of his weakest films First lets admit that 70 years later Spain is much richer than it was then and when I say this I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own like excessive individualism and consumerism though all in all wealth its a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored but with Western European style capitalism But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene the narrator chides that in school children are taught the value of Pi Teaching math to poor people the horror Buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation What is he proposing That children are taught exactly what at school Doesnt Buñuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people
1	The first von Trier movie ive ever seen was breaking the waves Sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa Europa tells a story of a young GermanAmerican who wants to experience Germany just after the second world war He takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train Because of his job he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany meeting with the killing of traitors and hunt for former nazi party members The society is suffering from corruption His uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train By coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called werewolves they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains The atmosphere is astounding The viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene Just when you think youve seen a lot europe

0	How unfortunate to have so many of my a list and good b list actors agree to do this movie but they did and that is what sucked me into watching it I had never heard of this movie but there was Cuba Gooding Jr right on the DVD cover and James Woods in the background how bad can it be In a word Very This movie starts ok has some twists and turns then just lays an egg The ending was so weak it was as if the writer got called away and his 4 year old son sat down at the type writer and hacked out the ending How ironic a for a movie titled The end game to have such a poor one These are the types of movies that can move a list actors to the b list in hurry I hope Cuba Gooding JR and James Woods dont make a habit of this
1	Far by my most second favourite cartoon Spielberg did after Animaniacs Even if the ratings were low so what I still enjoyed it and loved it was so funny and I adored the cast wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were in there and were just fantastic the whole cast were brilliant especially the legendary Frank Welkerbr br Id love to see this cartoon again was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant Also I can remember the hilarious moment where Brain cameos in it you hear his voice and it played the PATB theme instrumental that was just fantastic I love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in I wish this cartoon and Animaniacs came back i loved them

0	End Game started well the least said about the end the better it seemed like things were happening just to keep the plot going for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive intelligent person half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character we are given no reason for this apart from the next scene wouldnt make sense without it The whole story could have been told in about 30 minutes it would have made an average TV political drama The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr is very watchable however and James Woods does an admirable job consideringbr br The end game was honestly one of the worst films Ive ever seenand thats saying something Ive seen Gigli

0	With the exception of FAMILY this new season is worse than Season One I cant imagine what they are thinking As a fan of horror can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem but this series gets worse with each outing I cant imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day toiling to churn out such crap STORY Is that too much to ask for CHARACTER How can we give damn about the fate of ANYONE in these stories If we are not engaged who cares if they get carved up or whatever Almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or REASON why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting Even Dantes effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion Ironically the production values and performances tend to be up to speed while the content is utter crap I have great hopes for Exec Producers Garriss VALARIE UNDER THE STAIRS but we shall see
1	Michael Stearns plays Mike a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality He has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men thats when he loses it He believes that when women actually have sex thats when they lose any sense of innocence andor beauty So he strolls through the Hollywood Hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance ultimately shooting the men dead with a highpowered rifle with a scopebr br The seeming primary reason for this movies existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again The story comes off as more of an afterthought This is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as were treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation Of course seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism For one thing Mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger This is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrackbr br Those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another It even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds Mike and renders him uncertain how to react It unfolds at a very slow pace but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist Its a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screenbr br 710

1	British comedies tend to fall into one of two main types the quiet introspective usually romantic study and the farcical social satire Settings characters and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories Butterflies is perhaps the epitomé of the first type br br The scripts are very verbal including long interior monologues by the main character Ria a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life When she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman who makes his interest in her quite clear she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offeredbr br The acting and scripts are always on the money which makes ones reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one I was neither blown away by it nor turned off My mother on the other hand adored this show I think the degree to which one identifies with Rias dilemma is the most important factor in determining ones reaction to Butterflies

0	How a director of Altmans experience could ever expect us to want to spend time with or to care about what happens to a lead character who is neurotic a whiner a jerk with no redeeming qualities that is the central puzzle about this profoundly confused piece of work A monstrous piece of trash In addition to this crippling flaw the plot line requires serious concentration to follow The setup that the Branagh character walks into is so obviously a setup from the start that we are inclined to wonder whether the writer and director have totally lost respect for their audience This latter issue is at the core of the film it represents directorial selfindulgence with profound contempt for the taste values and intelligence of the viewer Very unusual for Mr Altmanbr br Patrick Watson
0	I was very displeased with this move Everything was terrible from the start The comedy was unhumorous the action overdone the songs unmelodious Even the storyline was weightless From a writer who has written successful scripts like Guru and Dhoom I had high expectations The actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all Of course Kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds I think Hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done They tend to exaggerate way too much In Chinese films this style works because that is their signature piece But Hindi cinemas signature are the songs A good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic But in the future Im sure these action movies will get much sharper Also to be noted Comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly Good Luck next time

1	Get ready for it This is one of my favourite films of all time I am relatively unaware of David Mamets writer and director other works but after having watched this film half a dozen timesits always a joy to watch I can say without hesitation that he is a genius This film is extremely well written and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit conartistry and back room hustles The feel of the film is very similar to The Sting 1973 and it also pays homage to film noirbr br Its quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters It is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watchbr br Generally the acting is superb especially Joe Mantegna but someone who I watched the film with remarked to me that its not a good idea to have a heroine Lindsay Crouse who is not only a gambler a smoker and a thief but also sports a bad 80s hairdo I agree but I think she is nevertheless outstanding in the rolebr br The less you know about the plot of this film the better just like Mamets most recent film The Spanish Prisoner because the ending will be even more impressive Just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance

0	When thinking of the revelation that the main character in Bubble comes to at films end I am reminded of last years Machinist with Christian Bale The only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the charactersbr br An understated yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life The title is cause for contemplation Perhaps we the audience are the ones in the Bubble as we are given no payoffs in the films slim 90 minute running time Audience reactions were often smug and judgmental clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves These characters are the ones people refer to as those that put George W back in office for a second termbr br Its sobering to consider how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when watching an audience jump to their feet for the exit as soon as the credits role This film has its merits and is deserving of consideration for the things it doesnt say outright
0	I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival Based on a novella by science fiction author Brian Aldiss this film attempts to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howe conjoined twins who are plucked from their family by an impresario in order to form a rock bandbr br Almost deliberately gimmicky the film is also too clever by half if youll pardon the pun By mixing genres styles and moods the directors whose previous film was the excellent documentary Lost In La Mancha lose their way pretty quickly I was never sure whether I was meant to take it all seriously or not Flashbacks dream sequences it was all just a bit much Plus the promised rock and roll just didnt move me I was reminded a bit too much at times of Hedwig and the Angry Inch a film I found original and moving But in this case the songs just werent as good nor were the main characters sympathetic A more unfavourable comparison would be the similarly disappointing Velvet Goldmine

1	The only reason I give this movie an 8 out of 10 is because there are few movies in my opinion that are perfect This little B picture is a taut story well told Ive always been intrigued by Alexander Knox but have seen him very few movies Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm a sad little man who turns into a monster He betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse The performance is one of the most chilling performances Ive ever seen Since World War 2 actors who played Nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for Oscars I imagine that since this was made during the war the Academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil But Knox puts in that kind of performancea man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer I still cant get over itbr br Marsha Hunt who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly is cast against type in probably the best performance Ive ever seen her give too Maybe not Oscar worthy but the best of her career Nothing against her I have enjoyed her in those slight roles she often played But here she proves she up to the task of heavier dramabr br If you like human drama stories or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis I highly recommend this fine little film
0	SLASHERS 2 outta 5 starsbr br Not really a very good movie but I did like the idea behind it and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with The movie is ostensibly an episode of a live Japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off danger zone and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them The survivor if there is one wins fame and fortune everyone else just winds up dead The main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad None of the real people seem real at all The actors playing the killers are kind of fun because they are portraying cheesy and overthetop caricatures of popular modern horror movie types and thats exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show The movie pretends to be done all in one take there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the danger zone and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly to hide the cuts from one take to another I would imagine
0	I had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this film because the title is now An Unexpected Love Its not really worth looking for but I was unfamiliar with both leads and wondered why they were headlining a lesbian flick on Lifetime Everythings pretty restrained and you dont really get an idea of who these characters are so as a viewer I wasnt able to become emotionally invested in the storyline I guess Im not the target audience for this but Im not sure who is Everythings muted and soft focus and earth tonesnothings very interesting I had a prurient interest in seeing two women make out but its handled so discreetly that I was disappointed Rent Personal Best instead
0	I gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned From the domestic violence to sexuality and many of the taboos therein Outside of the gore I really would not call this horror so much as I would science fictionbr br Its bleak depressing and hopeless While I dont mind a less than cheery ending Im really very tired of the humans suck cliché thats central to every movie I know you cant get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of selfhatred as a member of the human race but hows bout as a writerdirector we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the ALIENS KILLING THE HUMAN RACE are evil Right now if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die just go out find a lake and swim til your arms are tired This way you wont be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me I deserve to die for being alive Its silly not thoughtful and boring
0	Movie industry is tricky business because decisions have to be made and everyone involved has a private life too Thats the very original thesis of this feeble attempt at making an insightful film about film And indeed no better proof of the industrys trickiness than seeing Anouk Aimée and Maximilian Schell trapped in this inanity The insight consists of talking heads rattle off bullshit like should I make a studio movie that pays a lot or should I make an indie item and stay true to my artistic self Do the latter please Or our relationship is not only professional its private as well Its a rather complex situation to handle isnt it Yes it is my dear Between the insipid dialogs one gets glimpses of palm trees hotel lobbies and American movie posters no sign of nonAmerican film presence on the Croisette Recurrent slumber sessions are inevitable making the 100 minutes of the film feel like ages Jenny Gabrielle is spectacularly unconvincing in justifying her own presence in the frame
0	Camp Blood III is a vast improvement on Camp Blood II as it has sound mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot This time theyve ventured slightly further away from the car park the other two movies were filmed in which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what is supposed to be a remote wildernessbr br This time around theres a reality TV show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants This is hardly a new idea Ive seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer turns up but at least this one has a plot instead of people just randomly being stabbed with a knifebr br Unlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laughs I liked how theres a gunshot sound effect when someone gets stabbed early on and the way the boom mike hovers behind people like a phantombr br I dont know why anyone would want to make a third Camp Blood film I would have thought it would be better to start from scratch but they have at least tried with this one The half naked deformed woman was a bit much for me it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak who would get her clothes off for 5 just like they did in the second movie They still havent worked out that a machete is used for cutting not stabbing but oh well its a Camp Blood movie what do you expect If you like crap films youll get some fun out of this one

0	I saw this movie at a drivein in 1959 Until Howard the Duck I considered this the worst movie I had ever seen This movie tried to combine all the genera in one comedy horror teenage angst and the hot rod that must have sired My Mother The Car Maybe it deserves a second viewing to see if it is an accurate reflection of its time

1	The Scots excel at storytelling The traditional sort Many years after the event I can still see in my minds eye an elderly lady my friends mother retelling the Battle of Culloden She makes the characters come alive Her passion is that of an eyewitness One to the events on the sodden heath a mile or so from where she livesbr br Of course it happened many years before she was born but you wouldnt guess from the way she tells it The same story is told in bars the length and breadth of Scotland As I discussed it with a friend one night in Mallaig a local cut in to give his version The discussion continued to closing timebr br Stories passed down like this become part of our being Who doesnt remember the stories our parents told us when we were children They become our invisible world And as we grow older they maybe still serve as inspiration or as an emotional reservoir Fact and fiction blend with aspiration role models Warning stories Archetypes Magic and mysterybr br My name is Aonghas like my grandfather and his grandfather before him Our protagonist introduces himself to us And also introduces the story that stretches back through generations It produces stories within stories Stories that evoke the impenetrable wonder of Scotland its rugged mountains shrouded in mists The stuff of legend Yet Seachd is rooted in reality This is what gives it its special charm It has a rough beauty and authenticity tempered with some of the finest Gaelic singing you will ever hearbr br Aonghas Angus visits his grandfather in hospital shortly before his death He burns with frustration Part of him yearns to be in the twentyfirst century to hang out in Glasgow But he is raised on the Western shores among a Gaelicspeaking communitybr br Yet there is a deeper conflict within him He yearns to know the truth The truth behind his grandfathers ancient stories Where does fiction end And he wants to know the truth behind the death of his parentsbr br He is pulled to make a last fateful journey to the summit of one of Scotlands most inaccessible mountains Can the truth be told Or is it all in storiesbr br In this story about stories we revisit bloody battles poisoned lovers the folklore of old and the sometimes more treacherous folklore of accepted truth In doing so we each connect with Angus as he lives the story of his own lifebr br Seachd The Inaccessible Pinnacle is probably the most honest unpretentious and genuinely beautiful film of Scotland ever made Like Angus I got slightly annoyed with the pretext of hanging stories on more stories But also like Angus I forgave this once I saw the bigger picture Forget the boxoffice pastiche of Braveheart and its like You might even forego the justly famous dramatisation of The Wicker Man To see a film that is true to Scotland this one is probably unique If you maybe meditate on it deeply enough you might even reevaluate the power of storytelling and the ageold question of whether there are some truths that cannot be told but only experienced
0	The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic Everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry drop out I have actually seen better acting in low budget porn I though I had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene Jim Watch your ass Nick You watch yours together I wont leave you behindbr br The first action sequence shows how awful the production is but its really kind of funny Good guys have transformer weapons In one scene they all have fake HK MP5 submachine guns Next scene AK47 replicas And then to top it all off they do some weapon swapping between scenes with a couple of M16s I think they had a budget shortage for guns not enough to go around between the good guys and bad guys Fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as all hell You have to remove the pinspoon from a grenade for it to explode on its own You cant fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter Weapons that you throw away dont suddenly reappear When a gun is out of bullets throwing it away is still pretty stupid Unless you have no idea how to reload them Big slow trucks driving around in first gear make for awkward action scenes I really cant believe movies like this are actually produced This movie would be hilarious on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk
0	Spoilersbr br Wow END OF THE WORLD is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experiencebr br Here is the full story a scientist is getting messages from space a la INDEPENDENCE DAY The messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in China He starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so hes trying to figure out whos receiving the messages and whos also sending out messages in space He and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent They visit it Everything looks normal including the priest played by a bored Christopher Lee But the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent So he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens disguised as priests and nuns They are held against their will and the alien played by Lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet Once the alien get the special element the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform Lee being the last alien left tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens Lee walks in the transporter and hes gone The couple looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world decide to follow the aliens Because earth is doomed the couple doesnt see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear The last shot of the movie is a papier mache planet earth exploding The endbr br Thats it br br Ive never seen such a dull movie in my life Its the most underwhelming movie Ive ever experienced The scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen They dont care about anything They see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide what the heck who needs earth anyway They dont even try to stop them or do something to make things better This kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent The actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their paces so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work I wasnt expecting much with this movie because it IS a Charles Band production but I didnt expect it to be this badbr br Christopher Lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned STARSHIP INVASIONS Well Im sorry Chris but STARSHIP INVASIONS was actually goofy fun STARSHIP INVASIONS is terrible but terribly entertaining END OF THE WORLD is MUCH MUCH MUCH worst its beyond dull and inert with NO entertainment value whatsoever

1	Whats not to like about this movie Every year you know that youre going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible This movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well A very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him What is the good of having money like that if you cant do fun things with it It was a winwin situation A regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience Christmas like he imagined Only ifbr br Drew Latham Ben Affleck was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands It was a fun and funny movie

0	In fact it never was Im not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate a 1940s screwball comedy What a vacuous shambles None of these people come close to a Cary Grant Spencer Tracy Katherine Hepburn etc and anyway todays audience isnt as receptive to this facile muck Writing is trivial The hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious The chemistry between the leading characters is nonexistent Its interesting that Julia Roberts seems to think shes a reincarnation of some big star from the golden age of Hollywood whenever that may be Its an effect she tries and fails to attain yet again with Richard Gere in Runaway Bride

1	I borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating because I wanted to see how the crew manages to animate the presence of multiple worlds As a matter of fact they didnt at least so its seems Some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie thats it this is what the majority of viewers think However the surprise comes at the end and unfortunately then when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie I was also astonished when I saw that the BrazilianPortuguese title of this movie means Voyage into Death This is THE spoilerbr br That this movie is about a young girl who goes ALONE onto this boat on reasons that are completely unclear you understand only in the last 5 minutes When you start the movie with the English title Haunted Boat in your head you clearly think that the cameo appearances of strange figures are the ghosts But in reality this movie is not like most other horror movies told from the distant writerwatcher perspective who can at almost any time differentiate between different levels of reality it is told from the perspective of the young girl We see her not alone but together with the four friends because SHE sees them We do not see that she is alone So the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picturestream but the main story We have at least two parallel worlds The world in which the girl is and the world in which the 4 friends are An intrusion of a third world is probably the young man with the medical skills who comes for a short time on the boatbr br I cannot get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie the moviemakers cheated an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more or less a sophomore filmstudent elaborate with hastily chosen pseudoactors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers How mistaken can one be But in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes the end that follows gives another surprise The girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat When she has recovered from her shock she visits again the place at the harbor where she ascended the boat together with the four friends And there they are again They wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore She jumps into the water arrives at the boat and they are away Miraculously beautiful It remembers me a bit to the end of a poem by a Rhetoromance writer When I awoke I saw Death standing at my bed But I closed my eyes When I opened them again he was gone

0	I was very excited to see that they had made a movie out of my favorite book ever I didnt realize it was Disney until it was too late I was appalled by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story It was as if someone made a movie out of a 4th graders book report on the novel Meg did well in school and neither her nor her father wore glasses Mrs Murray Megs mother was not portrayed as much of a scientist at all they left out her kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet And thats just the beginning By halfway through the movie I found myself shouting at the screen much to the dismay of the other people who were watching the movie who hadnt read the book I wish I had more thumbs so I could give four thumbs down for this one The only good thing I can say is that for a person who has not read the book this movie is kinda alright
1	An excellent cast makes this movie work all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and its clear that the actors enjoyed filming this moviebr br Its not quite the comedy I expected much more a lighthearted look at the attempt to reclaim youthful glory than bawdy humor For music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funnybr br I hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies but so much of this movie reminded me of Alan Parker films I cant help it imagine if The Commitments actually did make it big and then tried to recapture said glory 25 years later
0	What happened What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie loses it Actually it never really got going There was a little excitement when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant then find out that she is after all but that was it Steve Martin who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie other than to make it longer I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters Kate and Angie and maybe try not for a pure comedy which unfortunately it was not but maybe a drama with comedic elements I think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here I can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot

0	This is without a doubt one of the worst movies EVER I emphasize EVER made What´s worse my old hero Dolph is in it and he´s starring it Jesus The story is actually quite good but the way it´s carried out made even my body hurt The fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter The actors except for Dolph who kinda sucks also perform so badly you can´t help but wonder if their reason for being there is that they´re all friends of the director who by the way must have been absent most if not all of the time This is §12 million spent in an unimaginable way because by the look of the effects and scenery the cost can´t be a cent above §1000

0	I found this film to be an utter dissapointment The talent available to the director notably Stanley Tucci Chris Walken Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin without even mentioning the four main leads have been completely wasted on an unfunny mediocre story whose conclusion one couldnt really care about once introduced to the dire stereotyped characters Julia Roberts is feeble ZetaJones is just plain annoying appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity minus the humour Crystal just plays his same old hyperactive neurotic annoying alterego and Cusack simply walks through his part apparently bored with the whole projectbr br For what is supposed to be a Romantic comedy there is absolutely no romance between the central characters let alone chemistry and as for the comedy possible SPOILERSwell the only moments of mild humour came off the back of Cusacks role in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever Spoilers Azaria was reasonably amusing as the Mexican lover and Walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthousemaverickDogme type director but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead Spoilers we were treated to Billy Crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog Pure geniusbr br For a huge fan of the majority of John Cusacks work not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast I was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost grossout teenmovie humour at timesbr br A very poor 410
0	I was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons For the first half hour its actually pretty decent Although the acting isnt any better then that which you would find in a rap video its kinda funny and the production value doesnt seem half bad In fact I almost thought this would be almost as good as Perico Ripiao another recent Dominican film which turned out to be MUCH MUCH better than I expected The plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in Dominican society as a whole which makes for a good premise especially in The Dominican Republic Unfortunately I dont think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter and they fing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them About 30 minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits Not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge space age CGI effects dating to what Im guessing would be the 70s but the whole plot just goes down the drain The rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations and clever one liners To top it all off and I guess I should warn you now SPOILER ALERT it all turns out to be a dream Oh my who didnt see that coming Oh man I almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie Well after about an hour into it I start thinking hmmmm something just doesnt seem right about the sound track but what can it be and then it hits me HALF OF THE MUSIC IN THE MOVIE WAS TAKEN FROM A VIDEO GAME CALLED KING OF FIGHTER 95br br When oh when DR will you give us a film we can call a work of art Perhaps a comedy to match Frances Amelie or an action flick to match Thailands OngBak an animation as Akira was to Japan a witty crime thriller as Layer Cake was to England or a socioawakening journey as Waking Life had here in the statesbr br i would give it a 1 but ive seen much worse come out of DR search Los Jodedores and youll know what Im talking about
1	Good funny straightforward story excellent Nicole Kidman I almost always like the movies shes in This was a good vehicle for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both A romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories great closing lines Chaplin very good here was also good in another good but unpopular romantic comedy Truth about Cats Dogs Maybe theyre too implausible Ebert didnt even post a review for this The great screwball comedies obviously were totally implausible Bringing up Baby etc If youve seen one implausible comedy youve seen them all Or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s Weird Birthday Girl is a movie Ive enjoyed several times Nicole Kidman may be the killer app for home video
0	With Knightly and OTool as the leads this film had good possibilities and with McCallum as the bad guy after Knightly maybe some tension But they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants It was of course totally superficial beautiful English country and seaside or notThe number one mistake was dumping Knightly so early on in the film when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part They missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and lowcost heartstring elements

1	Its been a while since Ive watched this movie and the series but now Im refreshing my memory This was a very funny movie based on the classic series Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were hilarious together Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse run Moonshine in the General Lee When Boss Hogg forces the Dukes off their farm Bo and Luke sneak around Hoggs local construction site and find samples of coal They soon realize that Boss Hogg is gonna stripmine Hazzard County unless the Dukes can stop him with the help of their beautiful cousin Daisy My only two problems with the movie was that Burt Reynolds wasnt right for the part of Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P Coltrane was way too serious Other than that I highly recommend THE DUKES OF HAZZARD

1	For Muslim women in western Africa married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard The community may not explicitly endorse such behaviour but equally they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal an attitude which of course enables it to continue Fortunately the letter of the Cameroonian law promises equality to all and this documentary follows the real life exploits of various female practitioners in the Cameroonian legal system as they attempt to secure justice for a number of women and children What is notable apart from the uplifting central story is how in spite of their informality the courts are actually pragmatically progressive if a case is actually bought The program also gives a fascinating insight the whole Cameroonian lifestyle which aside from the awful crimes committed in the featured cases seems amazingly emotional and joyous compared with that enjoyed by inhabitants of Europe or North America And while I concede that this comment may betray naiveté on my part this attitude appears to be captured in delightful pidginEnglish they speak Overall this is a terrific little film and much more fun to watch than you might imagine

0	When a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible the cause can invariably be found in the book either it was pointless to start with or the point is one not easily conveyed to film or the movie missed the point which is the most frequent of these results and the easiest to happen especially when the point is one not easily defined The book Morvern Callar has a point every reader of the book must have felt this and felt as if he had gotten it but I suspect most of them could not state it in words Im not sure I can myself but perhaps it comes to this or something like it Things come things go such is life but we carry on or at any rate some of uspeople like Morverndo No doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition But the important fact is that there is a pointpossibly the sum of the entire story is the pointand that this would have been the main thing to keep in view and to carry over in adapting the story to film The maker of this film evidently missed the point and doesnt substitute one of her own and so the film is about nothingbr br This is not the usual complaint of a booklover that his favorite text has been violated The merit of the book is something I conceded grudgingly in reading it I found it a bloody nuisance and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly The narrative is supposed to be the work of the halfeducated Morvern but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect as if the author were poking at her with his pen there are inconsistencies of style and tone as if different sections had been composed at different times and any conclusions I could reach about Morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not for instance despite Morverns own selfcharacterization as a raver am I wrong that in the end she remains essentially a workingclass Scots girl and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past In any case despite my irritation at the author I couldnt deny that his book stuck with me and what I couldnt get out of my head was his characters attitude her angle on the world which was almost as vivid as a Goya portrait Morvern is the kind of person whos always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her like flies so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful sloggingthrough unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophicaland that doesnt begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough The complex of incidents and of Morverns responses to them are the substance of the book and its achievement in exposing a crosssection of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise for all my dislike of the book I can see thisbr br The Morvern just described is not the Morvern of the movie or if it is most of her is kept offscreen An actress who might have been a good fit for the character had she been the right age at the right time is Angharad Rees from the old TV series Poldark Samantha Morton then would seem like good casting shes rather the same sort of actress and in one of her earlier movies Jesus Son she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one Unfortunately as the film turned out she doesnt have the character from the book to play For one thing the book is one that if it is to be dramatized virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience without her comments her perspective her voice the story loses most of its meaning It has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty and so Morverns responses whether of amusement or distaste depending on her mood are missing too and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story In short the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk edgy seriocomic novel into a genteel art TV film and chose as her typical image one of Ms Morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy as if the outing Morvern signs up for were a tour of the Stations of the Cross This isnt at all what the book or the Morvern of the book was about For another thing the Morvern of the movie isnt Scottish the actress said in an interview she hadnt had time to study up the accent and she ought to be its important that she her family and her mates are all from a single place And finally the film is missing the end of the story Morverns spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness its winter the dam has frozen the power has gone out and the pub is dark Minus this and minus all of the rest whats left is a failed art film a dead film about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal or native inability ever to give in to being dead
0	Slasherswell if you like horrors its definitely one to see otherwise dont even botherIt is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget For instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow trust me you wont need to look for themAlso try to ignore the cheesy actors if thats what you call themThe basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being 3 killers on the loose and whoever lives at the end gets rich Now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these daysFor example when i watched it i thought to my self i wouldnt mind having a go at this game especially for 12000000 so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind
1	This is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist and am I glad he did The blend of British humor should I say Humour and the reality of a lost middleaged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot Add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot those plants under the bushes were NOT going to make it without the TLC they received and it is a truly hilarious yet touching film I laugh every time I conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights Maybe its just my Mendocino County blood but the Brits definitely got this one right 1010
1	Nice movie with a great soundtrack which spans through the rock landscape of the 70s and 80s Radiofreccia describes a generation it describes life in a small village near Correggio hometown of Ligabue the singer who wrote the book that inspired the movie it describes life of young people and their problems relating to the world It reminds of Trainspotting with a bit of Italian touch
